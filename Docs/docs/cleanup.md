Here are the operations that can be performed:

* **Merge identical patterns** : Patterns that are identical on the same channel will be assumed to be the same and will all be replaced by instances of a single one. To be identical, patterns must have the exact same notes, effects, etc.

* **Delete empty patterns** : Patterns with zero notes or effect values will be deleted. Only applies to the selected songs. 

* **Merge identical instruments** : Instruments that have the same settings and envelopes will be combined into ones and every notes using the intruments to be deleted will use the new one. 

* **Delete unused instruments** : Instruments without a single note played will be deleted.

* **Delete unused samples** : Samples without a single note played will be deleted.
