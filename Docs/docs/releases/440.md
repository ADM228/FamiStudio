# FamiStudio 4.4.0 Highlights

FamiStudio 4.4.0 was just released! You can download it [here](https://famistudio.org/#download).

This is the first major release that has been driven almost entirely by community contributions. While I am focusing on another project, Steo has stepped up in a big way, conducting extensive hardware comparisons and adding numerous quality-of-life improvements. Thanks to him and everyone who contributed to this release!

Changes/Fixes:

* FDS multiwave support (thanks Steo!)
* DPCM options for "Trim to 16" and "Trim to 16+1" (thanks Steo!)
* Separate bass filter for FDS (thanks Steo!)
* PWM for FDS, including a fourth PWM preset (thanks Steo!)
* VGM FDS import support (thanks Steo!)
* NSF/VGM import tuning option (thanks Steo!)
* Linux support for kdialog and zenity for dialogs (thanks Steo!)
* Reworked C-binding and ability to combine identical channels in sound engine (thanks jroweboy!)

Breaking/Behavior changes:

* Default filtering options for FDS were changed slightly to better match the hardware
