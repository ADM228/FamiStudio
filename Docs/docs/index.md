# Installation

Depending on how you download FamiStudio, you might get scary warnings the first time you try to install or run it.

## Windows

On Windows, SmartScreen might say "Windows protected your PC".

## MacOS

On MacOS, GateKeeper is a bit more agressive. At first it will look like you simply cannot run it and it will give you the option to throw FamiStudio in the recycling bin.

To bypass this warning, open the "Security and Privacy" settings and look for the warning saying that FamiStudio was blocked.

Click "Open Anyway" and then you will have the option to launch it.
