Encoding FT2 stock:

	$00            Stop note
	$01-$7f        Note (n << 1) | e   Note n (e = 1 if note -> empty -> note, 0 otherwise) (GET RID OF THIS!)
	$80 | (n << 1) Instrument change, max 64
	$81 | (n << 1) Series of n empty notes (max 60 because 61 = $fb, 62 = $fd)
	$fb            Speed change
	$fd            Jump
	$ff, n, ref    Plays n notes starting at ref
	
New encoding:
	
	$00            Stop note
	$01-$58        Notes (like doug)
	$59-$5f        Free (for up to 7 effects)
	$60-$6f        Empty + Stop, up to 16 (???)
	$70-$7f        Volume (like doug), or make it a code + value? 
	$80 | (n << 1) Instrument change, max 64
	$81 | (n << 1) Series of n empty notes (max 60 because 61 = $fb, 62 = $fd)
	$fb            Speed change
	$fd            Jump
	$ff, n, ref    Plays n notes starting at ref
	
Effects doug added in FT3/4/5:
- 1xy/2xy      Slide up/down, useful since our pitch env are absolute. Good substitude for lack of HW sweep. DuckTables and JTS could have used that.
- 3xx          Partamento, useful, but wait until i see a game that uses it.
- 4xy          Vibrato, not needed, less accurate as an FX too.
- Qxy/Rxy      Similar to slide up, but stops after semitones. Portamento seems more general since it can do more than 15 steps. Which one is cheaper?
