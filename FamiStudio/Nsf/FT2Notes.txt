Encoding:

$00            Stop note
$01-$3f        Note (n << 1) | e   Note n (e = 1 if note -> empty -> note, 0 otherwise) (GET RID OF THIS!)
$80 | idx      Instrument change
$81 | (n << 1) Series of n empty notes
$fb            Speed change
$fd            Jump
$ff, n, ref    Plays n notes starting at ref

Idea:
- The sequnce note (with duration) -> stopnote -> new note is very frequent. THIS would require a special encoding, not the other crap, two possible ways:
	* Encode "n empty notes" + 1 stop.
	* Encode 1 stop followed by new note.
	
Effects doug added in FT3/4/5:
- 1xy/2xy      Slide up/down, useful since our pitch env are absolute. Good substitude for lack of HW sweep. DuckTables and JTS could have used that.
- 3xx          Partamento, useful, but wait until i see a game that uses it.
- 4xy          Vibrato, not needed, less accurate as an FX too.
- Qxy/Rxy      Similar to slide up, but stops after semitones. Portamento seems more general since it can do more than 15 steps. Which one is cheaper?
