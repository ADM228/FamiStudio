3.1.0
=====
x Recompile NesSndEmu on MacOS/Linux to get vrc7 volume fix.
x Stop note VS DPCM
- Linux radio color (messes up color on linux mint... ugh, buttons are white on Mint).
- 

Beta bugs:
- Osc doesnt take loops into account?
- 

Videos:
=======
- Sampling soundfont instruments
- Tutorial for FamiTracker

Doc
===
- Add replace instrument (with selection) info
- Gopnick errors
	1. Two attributes are missing, Instrument->Vrc6SawMasterVolume and Note->Release (legacy stuff?)
	2. The "general structure" part suggests "PatternInstance" as a child of "Song" while the indentation in the actual files indicates that it's a child of "Channel"
- Volume slide, noise slide
- Metronome
- OGG

Youtube corrections:
====================
- Patterns are one based.

Linux notes 
=========== 
- When slow startup in VM : dbus-launch --exit-with-session mono FamiStudio.exe 
- GTK# : sudo apt-get install gtk-sharp2  
	- This seem to be enough (sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-cil) 
- How to recompile with old linux: 
	- Ubuntu 16.04.6 
	- Install cmake-gui 
	- OpenAL Soft 
		- Install ALSA libs (libasound2-dev) 
		- Download openal-soft code 
		- Run cmake-gui in /build folder. 
		- Configure 
		- Choose static C + C++ libs 
		- Choose Release (no debug info) 
		- Generate. 
		- make! 
	- OGG:
		- Download ogg/vorbis code
		- cmake-gui, static lib, configure
		- CMakeFiles/vorbis.dir/flags.make, add -fPIC
			C_FLAGS = -O3 -DNDEBUG -fPIC 
		- Same for OGG
	- NesSndEmu + NotSoFatso, run script. 
	- RtMidi, need to add static C/C++ libs to cmake file. 
 
MacOS notes
===========
- MacOS Sierra, fully patched is 10.12.6, with AppKit version 1504.83.101
- Must compile the MacLauncher with this to link to the AppKit version that
  matches GTK+2. This will make MacOS load these older versions afterwards,
  even on more recent OS'es.
- Must compile vorbis on old version too (like Sierra). 
- If problem installing MacOS VM, see @DOUG fix at

- If NAT network doesnt work (problem is only in Monterey right now) do that:
	ethernet0.virtualDev = "vmxnet3"

3.2.0
=====
- Overclocking (2x, 3x, 4x would be a good start).
- Multi-expansions (dont want that garbage in the sound engine, would need to be a seperate NSF thing).

Backlog: 
=========
- NSF import read DMC initial value.
- Volume/effect scaling?
- Save snapping + qwerty settings + some export settings.
- Left/right pan with +/- (cubase style)?
- TailWindz : CTRL + Scroll should do "something"
- Hardware sweep (how to not conflict with smooth vibrato?)
- Write delta counter (Zxx).
- Scales
- Loop prevention for envelope (brad issue). 
- Raw FDS modulation table envelope. 
- Instrument folders + collapse entire sections (samples, arps, etc.) 
- Sign exe/setup on Windows (EV cert is too expensive) + Sign/notarize on MacOS (dont want to pay for developper ID). 
- Installer on Japanese machine? 
- Square selection: Sort-of works, but problems are with stop notes. To know if a stop note is in the square
  you need the previous note, but that note may just have been deleted (like in DeleteNotes), so its almost
  impossible to do without caching the stop note values.
