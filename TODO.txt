FamiStudio Tempo 2.0
====================
/ Build utils for tempo list
/ Basic UI.
	x Advanced section support
	x Add tooltip to other dialogs + Linux.
	- BPM selection:
		- Based on the tempo list + note length, find the tempo that matches the closest.
		x BPM computation will repeat the groove until its divisble by note length.
		/ We should display 3 comments like : "Integral", "Uneven", "Unaligned" ? (good, medium, bad).
		/ Advanced settings, groove list,
		/ Padding location
	x Move tempo dialog code to its own class, avoid duplicated code.
/ Native playback.
	/ Figure out which part need to handle visual notes and groove notes.
		/ BasePlayer 
		- Song.CountNumFrames. 
/ Adapted playback.
	x Compute envelope.
- Function to "bake" groove for export.
	- Let's reset the groove every pattern.
	- This will make things WAY easier.
	- Change FamiTone2 export to use the 2 free special code (delay cuts/notes) 
		- tempo envelope change
		- tempo envelope reset (jump to zero).
- Conversion to milliseconds.
- Improve resize, make it clearer what it will do (move grid, resize notes, etc.)/
	-> Does it work well with time signature changes, etc.
- Groove option for FamiTracker too? Look at 0cc, see how they present this to the user.

- Convert demo songs to new tempo
	- Gimmick
	- Tower
	- Any others?

- Format fixes:
	- Video speed, need smoothing?
	- Migrate strange values to 4 notes per beat.

FamiStudio 2.5.0
================
- Remove low pass, add reload.
- Loop prevention for envelope (brad issue).
- Note refactor: (2.6.0?)
	- Whole note drag, or FULL NOT REFACTOR.
	- When using 1/2 snapping, dragging notes is awkward. (will depend on tempo solution).

=============

- MAYBE: MIDI in/out (not sure... non-technical people will be disapointed)
- QWERTZ?
	- GTK colors. => Doesnt work on mac...
	- Test mac with weird keyboards.
	- If a key is a music key, should we not process it (1-5 changes channel, so playing a note changes the channel...).
- studX:
	- Song sorting from FTM.
	- Reverse 2xx effect??

Testing
=======
- MacOS : Scaling, etc. Find someone with a mac to test. Look at CPU usage.
- MacOS : "Whenever I minimize it tho, you can't open it back up by clicking on the icon. You have to right click it and click 'Show All Windows', then click the window there.". how2bboss.
- Linux : Test scaling more.
- Windows : Scaling, 150% and stuff for the warning in dialogs.
- OGL : Grey screen happens sometimes.

Linux notes
===========
- When slow startup in VM : dbus-launch --exit-with-session mono FamiStudio.exe
- GTK# : sudo apt-get install gtk-sharp2 
	- This seem to be enough (sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-cil)
- How to recompile with old linux:
	- Ubuntu 16.04.6
	- Install cmake-gui
	- OpenAL Soft
		- Install ALSA libs (libasound2-dev)
		- Download openal-soft code
		- Run cmake-gui in /build folder.
		- Configure
		- Choose static C + C++ libs
		- Choose Release (no debug info)
		- Generate.
		- make!
	- NesSndEmu + NotSoFatso, run script.
	- RtMidi, need to add static C/C++ libs to cmake file.

MkDocs
======
- Install Python
- pip install mkdocs
- pip install mkdocs-bootswatch

Backlog:
=========
- Raw FDS modulation table envelope.
- Rendering of note is sub-optimal, BG + lines + attack, etc. D2D batches if same shader.
- Instrument folders + collapse entire sections (samples, arps, etc.)
- Sign exe/setup on Windows (EV cert is too expensive) + Sign/notarize on MacOS (dont want to pay for developper ID).
- Mac: Paste special: Text is super dark
- Mac: Clicking on FS without the window doesn't give it focus...?
- Installer on Japanese machine?
- Keyboard recording VS. non-QWERTY keyboards.
- BUG: After cleanup, selected arpeggio + instrument seems wrong. (added notes make arpeggion sound, but none selected.)
- Highlight piano keys when they are pressed with QWERTY or MIDI. (LOW PRIO)
