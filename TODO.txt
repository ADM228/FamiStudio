1.5.0: FDS + PAL
================
- PAL support/tempo/speed:
	- 2 tempo modes:
		- FamiTracker : Tracker like, tempo/speed, delayed notes/cuts. Minimal effor to support.
		- FamiStudio  : Always 1 note = frame. Note size, PAL repetition pattern. (TEST THAT!)
	- *** Idea: Are they the same, but famistudio mode only works at speed = 1???
	- Do it in FamiStudio.
	- Fix rounding on weird tempos.
	- Delayed notes/cuts.
	- NSF (#defines)
	- Add better tempo logic to famitone2fs.
	- Make bar length more flexible (for short patterns too).
- FDS:
	- Only reset mod on new notes.
	- Modulation doesnt sound right.
	- Compare with FamiTracker/emulators.
	- NSF.
- Fine pitch track
	- NSF
- Duty cycle envelopes.
	- NSF
	- Test FamiTracker import/export
	- Test Famitone 2 export, etc.
- ROM export (Mapper 31):
	- Song change + controls (Need gamepad fix to prevent DPCM interference).
- NSF Import:
	- There is still something fishy with the pitches sometimes.
- Transform dialog:
	- Cleanup (merge duplicated patterns, instruments, fine pitch track, anything elemove unused stuff.)
	- Tempo conversion?
- Binary FTM import:
	x All expansions. TEST!
- Loop point should be optional.
- All expansions.
	- Finigh channel code, clean.
	- Import/export all formats.
	- Namco:
		- Period, figure how it related to wave length.
		- The range of notes still feels off. Too many notes on the low end.
		- Multi waves seems good with duty cycle envelopes... Later?
	- VRC7
		- Sustain should be ON by default. release = remove trigger.
		- Note table has << 2 baked in. Make sure im ok with that.
		- Vibrato, octave, etc.
	- Sunsoft:
		- See if gimmick had a differnt note table for PAL.
	- MMC5:
		- One game seems to use PCM... 
- When a mismatching channel is selected (expansions VS. none), pick first one. Less frustrating.
- Make all I/O class non-static.
- Remove VRC6 duty hack. Full volume range.

TESTING:
========
- FamiTracker import/export, retest Text, slides, etc. 
- Retest slide notes, etc. Everything that crosses boundary, with various pattern sizes, export to FT, etc.
- Retest slide note import/export to FamiTracker. Test a few cases.
- Test installer on Japanese machine.
- FTM, test a lot. Needs to match text import (export to text and compare).
- Compare relative volume of all channels.
- MAC: Make sure namco channels dialog works. Added Combo box prop change callback.

========================

Backlog:
=========
- P1: Fix crash on startup when there are no audio device (also freeze when switching audio devices)
- P1: Proper error messages when something fails (save, etc.)
- P1: Command line processing
- P2: Add taskbar progress bar + color to show playback state
- P2: Raw FDS modulation table envelope.
- P2: Rendering of note is sub-optimal, BG + lines + attack, etc. D2D batches if same shader.
- P2: Instrument folders
- P2: Note dragging.
- P2: Sign exe/setup on Windows (EV cert is too expensive) + Sign/notarize on MacOS (dont want to pay for developper ID).
