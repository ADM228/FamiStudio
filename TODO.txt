1.5.0: FDS + PAL
================
- FDS:
	x Project explorer advanced instrument params (move relative pitch env there).
	- FDS Wave cant be negative
	- Values above 61 are not visible.
	- Presets (saw, triangle, sine, square, etc.)
	- Proper playback (remove hacks)
	- NSF.
	x FamiTracker import/export 
	x FamiTracker instrument import.
- Fine pitch track
	- NSF
- PAL support/tempo/speed:
	- 2 tempo modes:
		- FamiTracker : Tracker like, tempo/speed, delayed notes/cuts. Minimal effor to support.
		- FamiStudio  : Always 1 note = frame. Note size, PAL repetition pattern. (TEST THAT!)
	- Do it in FamiStudio.
	- Fix rounding on weird tempos.
	- Delayed notes/cuts.
	- NSF (#defines)
	- Add better tempo logic to famitone2fs.
- Duty cycle envelopes.
	- NSF
	- Test FamiTracker import/export
	- Test Famitone 2 export, etc.
	- Improve default zoom on envelopes, range multipiler (2x / 4x) + offset for FDS range.
- ROM export (Mapper 31):
	- Song change + controls (Need gamepad fix to prevent DPCM interference).
- Remove jump and skip effects:
	x Jump is simply a loop point
	- Skip is a shorter pattern.
		x FamiTracker import/export (should we only support SHORTER patterns??? YES!)
		x FamiTone split, etc.
		- Retest slide notes, etc. Everything that crosses boundary, with various pattern sizes, export to FT, etc.
		- Retest seek
		- Retest slide note import/export to FamiTracker. Test a few cases.
		- We dont update MaxInstanceLength in all cases (song resize, change pattern length, etc.)
		- Handle where we change the song pattern length.
		- Truncate pattern to their maxlength.
		- Make dark version of seq header icon.
		- What to do with bar length on shorter patterns?
- instanceIdx -> patternIdx
- NSF Import:
	- Triangle in SMB3 has volumes of 24 (triangle has no volume!)
	- Avoid setting the volumes on new notes. Only if state.volume == 0.
	- Set correct song length.
- Transform dialog:
	- Cleanup (merge duplicated patterns, instruments, fine pitch track, anything elemove unused stuff.)
	- Tempo conversion
- Help button -> Documentation website.	
- Crash when importing FamiTracker songs with > 16KB samples.

========================

Backlog:
P0 All expansions.
P1 Fix crash on startup when there are no audio device (also freeze when switching audio devices)
P1 Proper error messages when something fails (save, etc.)
P2 Binary FTM import.
P2 Add taskbar progress bar + color to show playback state
P2 Raw FDS modulation table envelope.
P2 Rendering of note is sub-optimal, BG + lines + attack, etc. D2D batches if same shader.
P2 Instrument folders
P2 Note dragging.
P2 Sign exe/setup on Windows (EV cert is too expensive) + Sign/notarize on MacOS (dont want to pay for developper ID).
