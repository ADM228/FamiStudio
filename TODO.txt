Linux notes 
=========== 
- When slow startup in VM : dbus-launch --exit-with-session mono FamiStudio.exe 
- GTK# : sudo apt-get install gtk-sharp2  
	- This seem to be enough (sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-cil) 
- How to recompile with old linux: 
	- Ubuntu 16.04.6 
	- Install cmake-gui 
	- OpenAL Soft 
		- Install ALSA libs (libasound2-dev) 
		- Download openal-soft code 
		- Run cmake-gui in /build folder. 
		- Configure 
		- Choose static C + C++ libs 
		- Choose Release (no debug info) 
		- Generate. 
		- make! 
	- OGG:
		- Download ogg/vorbis code
		- cmake-gui, static lib, configure
		- CMakeFiles/vorbis.dir/flags.make, add -fPIC
			C_FLAGS = -O3 -DNDEBUG -fPIC 
		- Same for OGG
	- NesSndEmu + NotSoFatso, run script. 
	- RtMidi, need to add static C/C++ libs to cmake file.

FamiStudio 3.1.0 (Small quality of life release)
================================================
x Patterns one-based, start at one.
x Force reload FDS/N163/VRC7 instrument when song is playing and the user tweaks stuff.
x Metronome?
x Remove mapping.sample null check.
x Multiple sample import. => Or import samples from other projects?
x Stereo WAV/MP3/Video?
x .exportzp FAMISTUDIO_SFX_CH0 (brad issue)
x True portable mode (save FamiStudio.ini in same folder).
x Move "relative pitch env" to param.
x Is it needed to clear the undo/redo stack when saving? Make it an option? (What about when we add the filename?)
x Replace checklistbox.
x More verts in video osc?
x Compare noise channel in metal crusher.
x Look at changes in Nes_Osc
x OGG export.
x Make sure osc in video are flipped (3.0.2 fix, but video files have changed).
x Loop in selection for sequencer.
x Highlight piano keys when they are pressed with QWERTY or MIDI. 
/ Fine pitch adjust in DPCM editor. Make backward, save in file.
/ Oscilloscope export. Add more low bitrates + review is high bitrates are acutally used. If you choose 12000, does it really use that? Less high.
/ Scales? Or just highlight.
- Improve fine FX adjust (shift + drag, Gopnick request)
- Review OnMouseCaptureChanged, not good when playing with params.
- Sample display semitones + cents. (Could do "15 (C11 -17.9c)", not sure useful). Need something like -5s, 30 cents notations. Nonstandard. -530 cents?
- Save snapping + qwerty settings + some export settings.
- Cleanup seq/project explorer like piano roll. Nothing crazy, but basic cleanup.
- Merge CC65 stuff.
- Noise slides
	- Run unit test
	- Add slides to unit test.
	- Documentation (sound engine, FT)
- Volume slides.
- Option to use code instead of volume table.
- MMC3 rom.



- LOW PRIO : Look at wave offset (msg from Twitter)
- CUT : Keyboard shortcut for snapping precision?
- LOW PRIO : End of song looping behavior?
- LOW PRIO : Left/right pan with +/- (cubase style)?

Doc
===
- Add replace instrument (with selection) info
- 

Testing
=======
- Re-test song merge a lot. Removed a few cleanups.
- Re-test expansions issue (same instrument name, diff expansions, etc.)
- Stereo video crackles?
- WS clips children on win7
- Test OGG a bit more, make sure UI + command line works good
- Double check osc flipping in toolbar + video
- 

Random features ideas
=====================
- Overclocking (2x, 3x, 4x would be a good start). Would need to switch to a ROM with IRQ, MMC3? 
- Volume slides (how to make user friendly?)
- Hardware sweep (how to not conflict with smooth vibrato?)
- Write delta counter (Zxx).
- Noise slides.
- Multi-expansions (dont want that garbage in the sound engine, would need to be a seperate NSF thing).
- Oscilloscope only video mode.

Backlog: 
========= 
- Selection with min/max note.
- Loop prevention for envelope (brad issue). 
- Raw FDS modulation table envelope. 
- Instrument folders + collapse entire sections (samples, arps, etc.) 
- Sign exe/setup on Windows (EV cert is too expensive) + Sign/notarize on MacOS (dont want to pay for developper ID). 
- Installer on Japanese machine?
