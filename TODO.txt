1.5.0: FDS + PAL
================
- FDS:
	- Project explorer slider micro mode (hold shift)
	- Presets (saw, triangle, sine, square, etc.)
	- Proper playback (remove hacks)
	- Waveform should be centered? Nicer that way.
	- Dont allow looping/release in wave/mod.
	- NSF.
- Fine pitch track
	- NSF
- PAL support/tempo/speed:
	- 2 tempo modes:
		- FamiTracker : Tracker like, tempo/speed, delayed notes/cuts. Minimal effor to support.
		- FamiStudio  : Always 1 note = frame. Note size, PAL repetition pattern. (TEST THAT!)
	- Do it in FamiStudio.
	- Fix rounding on weird tempos.
	- Delayed notes/cuts.
	- NSF (#defines)
	- Add better tempo logic to famitone2fs.
	- Make bar length more flexible (for short patterns too).
- Duty cycle envelopes.
	- NSF
	- Test FamiTracker import/export
	- Test Famitone 2 export, etc.
- ROM export (Mapper 31):
	- Song change + controls (Need gamepad fix to prevent DPCM interference).
- NSF Import:
	- Avoid setting the volumes on new notes. Only if state.volume == 0.
- Transform dialog:
	- Cleanup (merge duplicated patterns, instruments, fine pitch track, anything elemove unused stuff.)
	- Tempo conversion
- Binary FTM import:
	- Name uniqueness
	- FDS
	- Converge more stuff with text import (make text import not static, move stuff to base).
	- Test test test!!! (Slides, etc.)
- Loop point should be optional.

TESTING:
========
- FamiTracker import/export, retest Text, slides, etc. 
- Retest slide notes, etc. Everything that crosses boundary, with various pattern sizes, export to FT, etc.
- Retest slide note import/export to FamiTracker. Test a few cases.
- Test installer on Japanese machine.

========================

Backlog:
=========
- P0: All expansions.
- P1: Fix crash on startup when there are no audio device (also freeze when switching audio devices)
- P1: Proper error messages when something fails (save, etc.)
- P1: Command line processing
- P2: Add taskbar progress bar + color to show playback state
- P2: Raw FDS modulation table envelope.
- P2: Rendering of note is sub-optimal, BG + lines + attack, etc. D2D batches if same shader.
- P2: Instrument folders
- P2: Note dragging.
- P2: Sign exe/setup on Windows (EV cert is too expensive) + Sign/notarize on MacOS (dont want to pay for developper ID).
