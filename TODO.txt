1.5.0: FDS + PAL
================
- PAL support/tempo/speed:
	- 2 tempo modes:
		- FamiTracker : Tracker like, tempo/speed, delayed notes/cuts. Minimal effor to support.
		- FamiStudio  : Always 1 note = frame. Note size, PAL repetition pattern. (TEST THAT!)
	- Do it in FamiStudio.
	- Fix rounding on weird tempos.
	- Delayed notes/cuts.
	- NSF (#defines)
	- Add better tempo logic to famitone2fs.
	- Make bar length more flexible (for short patterns too).
- NSF:
	x Fine pitch track
	x Duty envelopes.
	- Expansions
	- Retest smooth vibrato on/off.
	- Minor improvement: _FT2SetInstrument called on stop notes... silly.
	- Minor improvement: Envelopes run even when we had a stop note.
- ROM export (Mapper 31):
	- Song change + controls (Need gamepad fix to prevent DPCM interference).
- Transform dialog:
	- Cleanup (merge duplicated patterns, instruments, fine pitch track, anything elemove unused stuff.)
	- Tempo conversion? Or should that be in the song properties?
- Loop point should be optional.
- All expansions.
	- Finigh channel code, clean.
	- Import/export all formats.
	- Compare all channel volumes meticulously with nsfplay.
	- Namco:
		- Import/export fine pith scaling (all foramts)
		- As we add more channels, its support to start sounding like shit. Why doesnt it?
	- VRC7
		- Figure out whole pitch/slide thing.
			- In FamiTracker, 1xx,2xx doesnt work well with VRC7, clamps period, doesnt change octave
			- In FamiTracker, Qxx,Rxx works OK since can only change 1 octave at most.
			- In FamiTracker, 3xx works, but locks the octave.
		- Import/export fine pith scaling (all foramts)
		- Make sure FamiTracker import/export of slides works.
	- Sunsoft:
		- See if gimmick had a differnt note table for PAL.
	- MMC5:
	- FDS:
		- Mod delay or mod track (need mod track for NSF import probably... Will need wider range on fx panel)
		- Make sure FamiTracker import/export of slides works.
- When a mismatching channel is selected (expansions VS. none), pick first one. Less frustrating.
- Make all I/O class non-static.

TESTING:
========
- FamiTracker import/export, retest Text, slides, etc. 
- Retest slide notes, etc. Everything that crosses boundary, with various pattern sizes, export to FT, etc.
- Retest slide note import/export to FamiTracker. Test a few cases.
- Test installer on Japanese machine.
- FTM, test a lot. Needs to match text import (export to text and compare).
- Compare relative volume of all channels.
- MAC: Make sure namco channels dialog works. Added Combo box prop change callback.
- Binary FTM import. Try opening all the demo songs from FT.
- Duty cycle envelopes, make sure all import/export format support it.
- Fix saw in Shovel knight.

Breaking changes
================
- VRC6 saw duty (mention in FamiTracker compatibility section)
- 

========================

Backlog:
=========
- P1: Fix crash on startup when there are no audio device (also freeze when switching audio devices)
- P1: Proper error messages when something fails (save, etc.)
- P1: Command line processing
- P2: Add taskbar progress bar + color to show playback state
- P2: Raw FDS modulation table envelope.
- P2: Rendering of note is sub-optimal, BG + lines + attack, etc. D2D batches if same shader.
- P2: Instrument folders
- P2: Note dragging.
- P2: Sign exe/setup on Windows (EV cert is too expensive) + Sign/notarize on MacOS (dont want to pay for developper ID).
