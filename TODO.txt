1.3.0 Roadmap
=============
- Copy/paste support
- Change undo/redo keys on macos

Copy paste support:
===================
- Clipboard format:
	x For notes: a big array of notes.
	x For envelopes: a series of values
	- For sequencer: a 2D array of patterns.
x Icon
x Toolbar
x Only display selection if control is in focus (confusing, maybe have 2 colors?)
x Range selection in sequencer (cleanup a bit).
x Display envelope values as selection.
x Pattern dragging is broken
- Improve paste special dialog, ugly.
- Unify sequencer/piano roll selection min/,ax (inclusive or exclusive).
- Make sure can still scroll with mouse when selecting and stuff (scrolling should not be a capture operation maybe?).
- Esc: clear selection in active control.
- Mac:
	- Add line width param to GL
	- Up/down/left/right keys wont work

========================
Backlog:
