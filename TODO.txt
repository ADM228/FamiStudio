1.4.0: VRC6
===========
NOW:
x Validate FT export 100%
x Validate instrument import 100%
x Validate FT import 100%
- Make sure Shovel sounds legit (intro especially)

Polish:
- Has it gotten slower? Take RenderDoc capture to be sure we arent drawing crazy stuff.
x Only show None + current expansion in create instrument dialog.

Testing:
- Piano roll, selection, etc. Delete stuff, make sur FX and everything is consitent.
- Retest copy paste a lot...
- Note drawing, release, stop, from far away.
- Reset everywhere i changed to note.Clear();

1.5.0: FDS
==========
- Delayed cut + delayed note. This will allow us to to song without time = 1
	- Delayed note delays the whole row, not just the note. Which is good i guess, it makes it behave like a real not at a tick level.
	- What happens if you have a note at the 6th frame when running on PAL (which only has 5)???
	- 
x FDS support in NesSndEmu 
- FDS "envelope" in piano roll.
- Instrument refactoring? (base class + derived?)

========================

Backlog:
- Cleanup (merge duplicated patterns, instruments, remove unused stuff.
- Instrument folders
- PAL support
- Fix crash on startup when there are no audio device 
- Proper error messages when something fails (save, etc.)
- Add taskbar progress bar + color to show playback state
- Sign exe/setup on Windows (EV cert is too expensive) + Sign/notarize on MacOS (dont want to pay for developper ID).
