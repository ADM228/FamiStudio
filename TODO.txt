1.5.0: All expansions + PAL
============================
- PAL support/tempo/speed:
	- Basic FamiStudio tempo implementation, all UI works, render piano roll.
		- Do custom note lenght IMMEDIATELY. otherwise a bitch to retrofit.
		- Ask to convert when changing note length.
	x Make bar length more flexible (for short patterns too).
	x Allow custom patterns to be longer.
	x Only allow PAL when no expansion used.
	x Specify tempo changes in pattern.
	x Note resize, tempo change.
	x Hookup playback correctly.
		x Read frame skip at each pattern with custom tempo.
		x Patterns cant display shorter than 16 pixels.
	x Slides with odd tempo. 
	x Slides in FamiStudio tempo
	- Copy paste between differente tempos?
	
	- NSF: Fix rounding on weird tempos (any better ways of doing this???).
	- NSF (#defines)
	- Add better tempo logic to famitone2fs.
	- Import/export formats.
	- FT2 FS tempo version. (Rename Famitone2FS to FamiStudio).

- All expansions.
	- Import/export all formats: slides.
- When a mismatching channel is selected (expansions VS. none), pick first one. Less frustrating.
- MATTT.
- Piano roll: Look at everything that uses alpha => SLOOOOOW!
- BUG: When importing FTM with no instrument on a note, instrument still plays. Should be null
- BUG: Once I hit a bug where i could drag notes without clicking on them???

TESTING:
========
- FamiTracker import/export, retest Text, slides, etc. 
- Retest slide notes, etc. Everything that crosses boundary, with various pattern sizes, etc.
- Test installer on Japanese machine.
- FTM, test a lot. Needs to match text import (export to text and compare).
- MAC: 
	- Make sure namco channels dialog works. Added Combo box prop change callback.
	- Make sure instrument properties window pops UP when Y > 1/2 height
	- New functions to update some controls.
	- Export dialog label sizes.
	- ValidateDelegate
	- 0.5 pixel offset for pattern bitmaps.
- Binary FTM import. Try opening all the demo songs from FT.
- Duty cycle envelopes, make sure all import/export format support it.
- Fix saw in Shovel knight.
- Retest smooth vibrato on/off.
- Make sure that when there is no loop point, NSF stops.
- Test long pattern > 256 a lot. They will fail to export to FamiTracker.
- Test split of pattern longer than default.
- Test change active channel (press 1...5) while a transaction is happening.
- Test everything about note dragging, edge cases, interrupt while dragging, end of song, etc....

Breaking changes
================
- VRC6 saw duty (mention in FamiTracker compatibility section)

========================

Backlog:
=========
- P1: Fix crash on startup when there are no audio device (also freeze when switching audio devices)
- P1: Proper error messages when something fails (save, etc.)
- P1: Command line processing
- P2: Add taskbar progress bar + color to show playback state
- P2: Raw FDS modulation table envelope.
- P2: Rendering of note is sub-optimal, BG + lines + attack, etc. D2D batches if same shader.
- P2: Instrument folders
- P2: Sign exe/setup on Windows (EV cert is too expensive) + Sign/notarize on MacOS (dont want to pay for developper ID).
