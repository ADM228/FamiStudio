x Split famitone2 ASM into stock and my custom version.
x Verify that doug's encoding matches what I see in FT2.
x Look at list of features from FT3/4/5 (nesdoug), see which ones would be interesting (see how much it differs from stock FT2).
x Add "kernel" debug option to NSF export to test FT2 vs. FT2Ex.
x Improve NSF DPCM (add offset from C000).
x Tempo bug from GitHub.
