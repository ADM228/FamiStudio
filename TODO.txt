4.0.0
=====
- CRASH : Open 2 NSF in a row with diff expansions. editChannel is out of bounds.
- CRASH : 240 BPM / 1 / 1
- BUG : Shy mode vs. channel icons.
- BUG : Hide channels + scroll doesnt work. 
- BUG : Grid "a" bug from how2? Right click! Mac only???
- BUG : Notes per beat doesnt go to 1?
- BUG : Envelope dragging is broken

N163 Multi-wave:
================
1) Env editor
- PC: Highlight, cursors, tooltip.
- Mobile : Gizmos, highlight, etc.
2) Playback
/ Channel state
- Test no attack and stuff.
- Option to reset to beginning of wave.
3) NSF/Sound Engine:
- There are MATTT in the ASM
4) Polish
- FTI import
- Famitracker import/export.
- FamiStudio text.
- Same for FDS.

- *** Volume envelope for N163 doesnt show position in piano roll

P0:
- Remove ugly multiplication code for anything that isnt 5 channels.
- Add text box to numero up/down
- Improve snapping. (Ask Infu for feedback, he showed an app that he found intuitive)
	=> Way to temporarely disable snapping (FL studio does it with ALT).
	=> Context menu option to set the snapping to the length of a note ("snapping eyedropper")
	=> Remove 1-frame snap glitch.
	=> Snap effect values (at least give the option to!)
- Improve oscilloscope stability (use channel frequency)
/ Sequencer improvement
  	- Add shortcut ([2] ?). Make sure to abort capture if that happens.
  	- Add to context menu somewhere?
  	- Do it on mobile too

P1:
- Is CPU usage higher?
- Improve no-attack.
	- Allow disabling attacks if all envelopes of both instruments are exactly the same.
	- Draw attack as red if user makes a mistake.

P2 (Unlikely):
- Alphabetical ordering should be a bit smarter about numbers.
- BUG : Drag single pattern (with one note covring the entire pattern) from 1 channel to the other while its playing, the old note keeps playing and adds on top.
- BUG : Selecting a full pattern selects + 1 frame?
- BUG : "theres a bug where when you select a pattern multiple times and you try to change a note, the change is multiplied by the # of patterns you selected", see video.
- Sound output selection?
- Give better names to auto saves
- Android : Starting scroll on a slider (in vrc7 instrument) changes the value. How to fix???
- Volume/effect scaling, easy one we have context menus.
- Cleanup : remove duplicated fx values (ex: same volume applied multiple times)
- Paste special, option to rename patterns.
- ffmpeg path on Linux should work on path (Puna on CC discord).
- Uncompressed envelopes
- CLI only EXE (Linux only).
- C0 is hidden by scroll bars
- C0 is hidden in piano roll video
- Piano roll scale on desktop?
- Poppin issue on FDS? See messages from "JHÄ€KRI" on discord. Change volume on FDS with a blank waveform.
- Dont reset camera in piano roll when deleting instrument (probably to handle case where you were editing the instrument)

Testing:
========
- Restest sequencer hide channel a bunch, test vertical scroll bars, test mobile too. Make sure not broken.
- Restest slide notes on mobile, make sure gizmo is stable on both sides when releasing(up/down)
- Restest multiple songs per file (changed multiplication thing)

Batch convert PNG -> TGA
==========================
"c:\Program Files\ImageMagick-7.1.0-Q8\magick.exe" mogrify -path D:\Dump\Icons\Out\Tga -compress RLE -format tga *.png

Linux notes 
=========== 
- When slow startup in VM : dbus-launch --exit-with-session mono FamiStudio.exe 
- How to recompile with old linux: 
	- Ubuntu 16.04.6 
	- Install cmake-gui 
	- OpenAL Soft 
		- Install ALSA libs (libasound2-dev) 
		- Download openal-soft code 
		- Run cmake-gui in /build folder. 
		- Configure 
		- Choose static C + C++ libs 
		- Choose Release (no debug info) 
		- Generate. 
		- make! 
	- OGG:
		- Download ogg/vorbis code
		- cmake-gui, static lib, configure
		- CMakeFiles/vorbis.dir/flags.make, add -fPIC
			C_FLAGS = -O3 -DNDEBUG -fPIC 
		- Same for OGG
	- NesSndEmu + NotSoFatso, run script. 
	- RtMidi, need to add static C/C++ libs to cmake file. 
 
MacOS notes
===========
- MacOS Sierra, fully patched is 10.12.6, with AppKit version 1504.83.101
- Must compile vorbis on old version too (like Sierra). 
- If problem installing MacOS VM, see @DOUG fix at
  https://www.geekrar.com/how-to-fix-the-cpu-has-been-disabled-by-the-guest-os/
	cpuid.0.eax = "0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:1011"
	cpuid.0.ebx = "0111:0101:0110:1110:0110:0101:0100:0111"
	cpuid.0.ecx = "0110:1100:0110:0101:0111:0100:0110:1110"
	cpuid.0.edx = "0100:1001:0110:0101:0110:1110:0110:1001"
	cpuid.1.eax = "0000:0000:0000:0001:0000:0110:0111:0001"
	cpuid.1.ebx = "0000:0010:0000:0001:0000:1000:0000:0000"
	cpuid.1.ecx = "1000:0010:1001:1000:0010:0010:0000:0011"
	cpuid.1.edx = "0000:0111:1000:1011:1111:1011:1111:1111"
- If NAT network doesnt work (problem is only in Monterey right now) do that:
	ethernet0.virtualDev = "vmxnet3"

Convert PNG to TGA

Backlog: 
=========
- Reorder channels for video export.
- ROM export with expansion?
- More options for oscilloscope (https://github.com/maxim-zhao/SidWizPlus/wiki)
- Overclocking (2x, 3x, 4x would be a good start).
- Save snapping + qwerty settings + some export settings.
- Left/right pan with +/- (cubase style)?
- Hardware sweep (how to not conflict with smooth vibrato?)
- Scales
- Raw FDS modulation table envelope. 
- Instrument folders + collapse entire sections (samples, arps, etc.)
