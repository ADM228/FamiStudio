1.5.0: FDS + PAL
================
- FDS:
	- Project explorer slider micro mode (hold shift)
	- Presets (saw, triangle, sine, square, etc.)
	- Proper playback (remove hacks)
	- NSF.
- Fine pitch track
	- NSF
- PAL support/tempo/speed:
	- 2 tempo modes:
		- FamiTracker : Tracker like, tempo/speed, delayed notes/cuts. Minimal effor to support.
		- FamiStudio  : Always 1 note = frame. Note size, PAL repetition pattern. (TEST THAT!)
	- Do it in FamiStudio.
	- Fix rounding on weird tempos.
	- Delayed notes/cuts.
	- NSF (#defines)
	- Add better tempo logic to famitone2fs.
- Duty cycle envelopes.
	- NSF
	- Test FamiTracker import/export
	- Test Famitone 2 export, etc.
	- Create a default duty envelope for all instruments.
- ROM export (Mapper 31):
	- Song change + controls (Need gamepad fix to prevent DPCM interference).
- Remove jump and skip effects:
	x Jump is simply a loop point
	- I DONT LIKE MY DESIGN: TOO COMPLEX. REQUIREMENTS
		1) Move things on patterns. 
		2) When changing params, warn that it will propage to patterns in same column and de-instanciate if needed.
	- Skip is a shorter pattern.
		x FamiTracker import/export (should we only support SHORTER patterns??? YES!)
		x FamiTone split, etc.
		- Retest slide notes, etc. Everything that crosses boundary, with various pattern sizes, export to FT, etc.
		- Retest seek
		- Retest slide note import/export to FamiTracker. Test a few cases.
		- We dont update MaxInstanceLength in all cases (song resize, change pattern length, etc.)
		- Handle where we change the song pattern length.
		- Truncate pattern to their maxlength.
		- Make dark version of seq header icon.
		- What to do with bar length on shorter patterns?
	- When 2 icons (loop + custom) are in same pattern, looks like shit.
	- Dont display icon at high zoom levels? Or at least clip them to pattern size.
- NSF Import:
	- Avoid setting the volumes on new notes. Only if state.volume == 0.
- Transform dialog:
	- Cleanup (merge duplicated patterns, instruments, fine pitch track, anything elemove unused stuff.)
	- Tempo conversion
- Test installer on Japanese machine.

* BUG: If select really fast in sequencer, selection makes no sense.
* BUG: Lots of bad last volumes in castlevania 3 saw track.
* BUG: Dragging patterns in sequencer does update piano roll.
* CRASH: GetLastValidNote gets asserts. (Likely due to DeleteSelectedNotes() not calling UpdateLastValid()).

========================

Backlog:
P0 All expansions.
P1 Fix crash on startup when there are no audio device (also freeze when switching audio devices)
P1 Proper error messages when something fails (save, etc.)
P2 Binary FTM import.
P2 Add taskbar progress bar + color to show playback state
P2 Raw FDS modulation table envelope.
P2 Rendering of note is sub-optimal, BG + lines + attack, etc. D2D batches if same shader.
P2 Instrument folders
P2 Note dragging.
P2 Sign exe/setup on Windows (EV cert is too expensive) + Sign/notarize on MacOS (dont want to pay for developper ID).
