1.4.0: VRC6
===========
- GOAL: Play Shovel Knight first track.
	
x Refactor to have variying number of channels
- FamiTracker TXT import/export
- NSF support too.
- WAV support.
x Tooltip warning on incomparible instruments
x Lower register notes for VRC6? 
- Slide notes. (fix keyboard shortcut, Mac, etc.)
- VRC6 shadow register for seeking.
- To test:
	- NSF: Try putting multiple things at once: volume + slide, volume + jump, etc. etc. Must all work.
	- NSF: Retest volume tracks
	- Copy paste: Handle all edge cases where you could copy from one expansion to another.
	- Note drawing, release, stop, from far away.
- Fix all MATTT
- Make it very clear what is an expansion channel (color, icon, etc.). Visually must match instrument. 
- Shovel Knight song:
	- Noise track has weird 1 beat offset. Might need to start envelope at zero + move.
- Pass current note pitch to ComputeSlideNoteParams so it doesnt know about NesApu note table.
- BUG: After using expansion, new file -> weird grey square below sequencer (reset layout?).
- BUG: Changing color of instrument in project explorer doesnt refresh piano roll.

1.5.0: FDS & MMC5
================
- FDS support in NesSndEmu 
- Instrument refactoring (base class + derived)
- Instrument icons.
- 

========================
Backlog:
- Cleanup (merge duplicated patterns, instruments, remove unused stuff.
- Instrument folders
- PAL support
- Fix crash on startup when there are no audio device 
- Proper error messages when something fails (save, etc.)
- Add taskbar progress bar + color to show playback state
- Sign exe/setup on Windows (EV cert is too expensive) + Sign/notarize on MacOS (dont want to pay for developper ID).
