Linux notes 
=========== 
- When slow startup in VM : dbus-launch --exit-with-session mono FamiStudio.exe 
- GTK# : sudo apt-get install gtk-sharp2  
	- This seem to be enough (sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-cil) 
- How to recompile with old linux: 
	- Ubuntu 16.04.6 
	- Install cmake-gui 
	- OpenAL Soft 
		- Install ALSA libs (libasound2-dev) 
		- Download openal-soft code 
		- Run cmake-gui in /build folder. 
		- Configure 
		- Choose static C + C++ libs 
		- Choose Release (no debug info) 
		- Generate. 
		- make! 
	- NesSndEmu + NotSoFatso, run script. 
	- RtMidi, need to add static C/C++ libs to cmake file.

FamiStudio 3.1.0
================
- Multiple sample import. => Or import samples from other projects?
- Save snapping + qwerty settings + some export settings.
	=> Make sure we can repeat last import with stereo settings.
- Patterns one-based, start at one.
x Force reload FDS/N163/VRC7 instrument when song is playing and the user tweaks stuff.

- Cleanup seq/project explorer like piano roll. Nothing crazy, but basic cleanup.
/ Fine pitch adjust in DPCM editor.
- Is it needed to clear the undo/redo stack when saving? Make it an option?
x Stereo WAV/MP3/Video?
- Highlight piano keys when they are pressed with QWERTY or MIDI. 
- Noise slides? What about slow slides?
- Loop in selection for sequencer.
- Keyboard shortcut for snapping precision.
- .exportzp FAMISTUDIO_SFX_CH0 (brad issue)
- True portable mode (save FamiStudio.ini in same folder).

- LOW PRIO : End of song looping behavior?
- LOW PRIO : Left/right pan with +/- (cubase style)?

Backlog: 
========= 
- Loop prevention for envelope (brad issue). 
- Raw FDS modulation table envelope. 
- Instrument folders + collapse entire sections (samples, arps, etc.) 
- Sign exe/setup on Windows (EV cert is too expensive) + Sign/notarize on MacOS (dont want to pay for developper ID). 
- Installer on Japanese machine?
