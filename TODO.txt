1.4.0: VRC6
===========
Polish:
- Tooltip error envelope resize (bad mouse button)
- When pasting envelope values, the project explorer env icon doesnt update
- Work VRC6 -> new file -> gray box over piano roll.
- Slide icons mid line is too thick.
- Make no attack icon for release notes. (something is not right here... debug)
- Last note of bass in shovel knight extends beyond the end
- Slide note at end of song should stop there.
- When pasting/deleting selection, I think we dont update the last pattern notes.

New attack + simple slide note:
x Remove portamento code.
x Smaller slide icon for releases
x Implement FT export immediately. Biggest risk.
	- Need to do attack management now.
- FamiTracker import.
x ASM for no attack.
x ASM for vibrato. 

Shovel Knight:
- Sq1:
	- 
- Noise: track has weird 1 beat offset. Might need to start envelope at zero + move.
- Optimize! I feel like lots of patterns are almost identical
- Optimize drum channel. Some snares look like same with volume.
- Recheck all pattern volumes at end. Pattern re-use could end up with different volume.

Testing:
- NSF: Restest all songs, old FT2, etc.
- NSF: Try putting multiple things at once: volume + slide, volume + jump, etc. etc. Must all work.
- NSF: Retest volume tracks
- Piano roll, selection, etc. Delete stuff, make sur FX and everything is consitent.
- Retest copy paste a lot...
- Note drawing, release, stop, from far away.
- Reset everywhere i changed to note.Clear();

1.5.0: FDS
==========
- FDS support in NesSndEmu 
- FDS "envelope" in piano roll.
- Instrument refactoring? (base class + derived?)

========================
Backlog:
- Cleanup (merge duplicated patterns, instruments, remove unused stuff.
- Instrument folders
- PAL support
- Fix crash on startup when there are no audio device 
- Proper error messages when something fails (save, etc.)
- Add taskbar progress bar + color to show playback state
- Sign exe/setup on Windows (EV cert is too expensive) + Sign/notarize on MacOS (dont want to pay for developper ID).
