2.2.0
=====
- Play right note when dragging.
- BUG: Select expansions instrument, change expansions, will delete the exp instruments, old instrument still referenced and can draw in track.
	- Also, if an arpeggio was selected, gets confused. Audio still plays arpeggio, but does not add to piano roll.
- FamiStudio sound engine
	- Multi property tab width on Linux/Mac
- Arpeggio : 
	- Validation code.
	- Paste special
	- Make rendering nicer +(1,1) pixel
	- FamiTracker: There is a MATTT thing that crashes when loading FDS_rushjet1_-_fdx.ftm.
	x Replace selection arp
	x Add/remove arps.
	- Must delete + add note to set the arp, weird?
	- Should I use a "..." icon for arps?
	- Drag to copy arpeggio in project explorer.
	- Cant select values in piano roll when editing arpeggios???
	- Documentation.
/ Show piano roll rect in sequencer
	x Make it a setting
	- Make it look better.
- Save export folder.
- Option to not play notes when dragging.
- Drag seek bar (github issue request!).
- Instrument picker?
- Discord server
- Feature requests from email (record?)

Testing:
========
- Retest ROM export.
- Test tutorial dialog with high DPI : mac + windows
- Deprecate FamiTone2 FS.
- One bad pixel in ROM, make sure its gone.
- Bad sequencer texture filtering : Re-test Mac + Linux.
- Retest export dialog in HiDPI.
- Retest Famitone2/FamiStudio engine/SFX export.

Tweet ideas
===========
- Tweet the linux screenshots, find a dev who wants to help.
- Tips of the week or something, animated GIFs.

MaxWar wish list.
=================
- Copy patterns to other channels.
- Option for no-sound when no-pattern?
- Loop end point
- MIDI import/export.
	
Linux notes
===========
- When slow startup in VM : dbus-launch --exit-with-session mono FamiStudio.exe
- GTK# : sudo apt-get install gtk-sharp2 
	- This seem to be enough (sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-cil)
- How to recompile with old linux:
	- Ubuntu 16.04.6
	- Install cmake-gui
	- OpenAL Soft
		- Install ALSA libs (libasound2-dev)
		- Download openal-soft code
		- Run cmake-gui in /build folder.
		- Configure
		- Choose static C + C++ libs
		- Choose Release (no debug info)
		- Generate.
		- make!
	- NesSndEmu + NotSoFatso, run script.
	- RtMidi, need to add static C/C++ libs to cmake file.

Trailer/scroll

MkDocs
======
- Install Python

Backlog:
=========
- P1: Fix crash on startup when there are no audio device (also freeze when switching audio devices)
- P1: Proper error messages when something fails (save, etc.)
- P2: Raw FDS modulation table envelope.
- P2: Rendering of note is sub-optimal, BG + lines + attack, etc. D2D batches if same shader.
- P2: Instrument folders
- P2: Sign exe/setup on Windows (EV cert is too expensive) + Sign/notarize on MacOS (dont want to pay for developper ID).
- P2: Mac: Paste special: Text is super dark
- P2: Mac: Clicking on FS without the window doesn't give it focus...?
- P2: Installer on Japanese machine?
- P2: FamiTracker tempo mode never plays the 1st frame in the NSF.
