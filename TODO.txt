FamiStudio 2.4.0
================
- Trailer
- DPCM tutorial

FamiStudio 2.5.0
================
- Get rid of OpenTK window on MacOS
	- Fix OpenGL issues
	- Bring back pinch to zoom, scaling, etc.
- QWERTZ?
	- Windows + GTK are well behaved
	- OpenTK verson is too old to work.
- FamiStudio Tempo 2.0 => Arbitrary BPM.
	- Figure out fundamental difference between tempo vs. groove
	- Look at gyuss for example (7-6-6, cycle over 120 frames)
- Add "saw master volume" to VRC6 instruments?
- More compact sequencer. (move force display to right, smaller pattern headers).
- MIDI in/out
- Oscilloscope + volume tracks display.
- Double-right-click = select whole note (or whole note drag?)
- When using 1/2 snapping, dragging notes is awkward.
- Sort song other than alphabetically.
- DPCM : More stuff, normalize volume? Playback speed? See people's request.
- Channel volumes settings in config.

Tips & Tricks (Review this list)
================================
Is #00 necessary???

#00 - Basic controls & onboarding (tutorial, pan, zoom, trackpad, tooltips, piano roll view rect, demo songs, documentation)
	Sequencer basics (pattern add, delete, edit, undo/redo, instance & copy).
	Piano roll basics (add note, delete note, snapping, dragging, select, transpose with KB).
	Channels in piano roll (force display, muting & soloing, etc.)
	
#01 - Volume envelopes & release notes (first envelope tutotrial, delete/copy, resize, loop/release, drag, keyboard, etc.)
#02 - Toggling note attacks (combination with release)
#03 - Slide notes (combination with release notes)
#04 - Pitch envelopes (absolute & relative, paste text values)
#05 - Effect panel (speed, different channe have different fx, FamiTracker tempo, etc.)
#06 - Copying & Pasting (special paste, special delete, mix paste, drag & copy, between projects, etc. Review all ways to duplicate note fast)
#xx - Custom pattern settings & loop points.
#xx - Recording with Keyboard or MIDI controller (page up/down, keys, etc.)
#xx - Importing instruments & songs
#xx - Importing from FamiTracker
#xx - Importing NSFs (bit reverse, tempo, reverse engineer instruments, etc.)
#xx - Tempo modes (FamiStudio / FamiTracker, PAL, toolbar icon, etc.)
#xx - DPCM samples (import, save, transpose, pitch, bit reverse, etc)
#-- - Replacing an instrument by another (copy envelopes, etc.)
#xx - Arpeggios (comparison with arpeggio envelopes, replacing, difference with FamiTracker (no-attack), etc.)
#xx - Importing/Exporting from/to FamiTracker (fti, etc)
#xx - Exporting to a NSF / ROM / FDS Disk
#xx - Exporting to Video.
#xx - VRC6 / MMC5 / S5B audio expansions
#xx - FDS audio expansion (waveform, modulation, master volume, FDS disk export, etc.)
#xx - VRC7 audio expansion (release envelope, only 1 custom patch at a time, etc.)
#xx - N163 audio expansion (wavetable, number of channels => quality, etc.)
#xx - Cleaning up your project.
#xx - Using the sound engine in your Homebrew game.
#xx - Command line processing (ex: export a FamiTracker file to mp3).

Linux notes
===========
- When slow startup in VM : dbus-launch --exit-with-session mono FamiStudio.exe
- GTK# : sudo apt-get install gtk-sharp2 
	- This seem to be enough (sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-cil)
- How to recompile with old linux:
	- Ubuntu 16.04.6
	- Install cmake-gui
	- OpenAL Soft
		- Install ALSA libs (libasound2-dev)
		- Download openal-soft code
		- Run cmake-gui in /build folder.
		- Configure
		- Choose static C + C++ libs
		- Choose Release (no debug info)
		- Generate.
		- make!
	- NesSndEmu + NotSoFatso, run script.
	- RtMidi, need to add static C/C++ libs to cmake file.

MkDocs
======
- Install Python
- pip install mkdocs
- pip install mkdocs-bootswatch

Backlog:
=========
- Raw FDS modulation table envelope.
- Rendering of note is sub-optimal, BG + lines + attack, etc. D2D batches if same shader.
- Instrument folders + collapse entire sections (samples, arps, etc.)
- Sign exe/setup on Windows (EV cert is too expensive) + Sign/notarize on MacOS (dont want to pay for developper ID).
- Mac: Paste special: Text is super dark
- Mac: Clicking on FS without the window doesn't give it focus...?
- Installer on Japanese machine?
- Keyboard recording VS. non-QWERTY keyboards.
- BUG: After cleanup, selected arpeggio + instrument seems wrong. (added notes make arpeggion sound, but none selected.)
- Highlight piano keys when they are pressed with QWERTY or MIDI. (LOW PRIO)
