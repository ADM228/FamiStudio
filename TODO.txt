FamiStudio 2.5.0
================
- MacOS : Filter NSWindow to only main window!
- QWERTZ?
	- Windows + GTK are well behaved
	- Let people configure the keys.
	- If a key is a music key, should we not process it (1-5 changes channel, so playing a note changes the channel...).
	- Shift-Q to toggle.
- Desktop scaling on Linux.
- Scroll bars?	
- FamiStudio Tempo 2.0 => Arbitrary BPM.
	- Figure out fundamental difference between tempo vs. groove
	- Look at gyuss for example (7-6-6, cycle over 120 frames)
	- Need to be perfect hybrid of trackers/DAWs.
- Add "saw master volume" to VRC6 instruments.
- More compact sequencer. (move force display to right, smaller pattern headers).
- Oscilloscope + volume tracks display.
- Whole note drag.
- When using 1/2 snapping, dragging notes is awkward. (will depend on tempo solution).
- Sort song other than alphabetically.
- Loop prevention for envelope (brad issue).
- Channel volumes settings in config.

- MAYBE: MIDI in/out (not sure... non-technical people will be disapointed)
- MAYBE: DPCM : More stuff, normalize volume? Playback speed? See people's request.

Testing
=======
- MacOS : Scaling, etc. Find someone with a mac to test.

Linux notes
===========
- When slow startup in VM : dbus-launch --exit-with-session mono FamiStudio.exe
- GTK# : sudo apt-get install gtk-sharp2 
	- This seem to be enough (sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-cil)
- How to recompile with old linux:
	- Ubuntu 16.04.6
	- Install cmake-gui
	- OpenAL Soft
		- Install ALSA libs (libasound2-dev)
		- Download openal-soft code
		- Run cmake-gui in /build folder.
		- Configure
		- Choose static C + C++ libs
		- Choose Release (no debug info)
		- Generate.
		- make!
	- NesSndEmu + NotSoFatso, run script.
	- RtMidi, need to add static C/C++ libs to cmake file.

Trailer/scroll

MkDocs
======
- Install Python
- pip install mkdocs
- pip install mkdocs-bootswatch

Backlog:
=========
- Raw FDS modulation table envelope.
- Rendering of note is sub-optimal, BG + lines + attack, etc. D2D batches if same shader.
- Instrument folders + collapse entire sections (samples, arps, etc.)
- Sign exe/setup on Windows (EV cert is too expensive) + Sign/notarize on MacOS (dont want to pay for developper ID).
- Mac: Paste special: Text is super dark
- Mac: Clicking on FS without the window doesn't give it focus...?
- Installer on Japanese machine?
- Keyboard recording VS. non-QWERTY keyboards.
- BUG: After cleanup, selected arpeggio + instrument seems wrong. (added notes make arpeggion sound, but none selected.)
- Highlight piano keys when they are pressed with QWERTY or MIDI. (LOW PRIO)
