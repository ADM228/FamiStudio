2.1.0
=====
- MaxWar wish list.
	x Copy patterns instead of instancing? How?
	x BUG: Special paste VS. volume (WAIT GIF, DONT UNDERSTAND!).
	x Cropped text special paste 150%.
	x CRASH: envelope.
	x CRASH: Copy/paste empty patterns. => Mac Test!
	x Better folder handling
	x Time mode change on click.
	x BUG: ALT + MOUSE WHEEL. (*** VERY HARD TO REPRO.)
	x BUG: Double right click, replace instrument, CTRL up/down.
- Copy paste of text values in envelopes.
	x Try to use real clipboard on Mac.
	x Do it!
	x MacOS
- Trackpad/pen controls
	x Send test builds (sunday).
	x Review MacOs speed + real mouse wheel.
	- Review scrolling direction on Linux.
x Paste-mix (NyxTheShield).
- Snap.
	x Will need awareness of patterns for custom note sizes.
	x Selection + drawing + dragging should be enough for good first pass.
	x Selection snap VS. Fraction.
	x FamiTracker tempo mode for 1,2,3,4 mode.
	x SNAPPING 1/2 in 11 frames does 6-5-5-6, is that good or bad?
	- Snap stop + release notes?
	- Mac/Linux
	- TEST A LOT (envelope, DPCM, etc)
- PAL mode editing.
	- Cleanup tempo envelopes.
		- Avoid skip at half note?
		- Or regular distribution?
	x Add to NSF driver. (Create tests before, cant break anything).
	- ROM => Add to song table + dual more kernel.
	- Export make PAL/NTSC default where it makes sense (ROM, NSF, etc).
	- FamiTone2FS
	- NSF IMPORT! WRONG NOTE TABLE!
	- Testing
		- NSF A LOT! Export NSF and reimport to make sure skips/double frames are good.
			- ntsc nsf stalls?
		- Playback: FamiTracker, FamiStudio, all mix, compare with old version, etc.
		- Register player : PAL/NTSC, FamiTracker/FamiStudio.
		- Wav export.
	- Remove debug print in Player when done.
- Show envelope values.
- Slides in NSF dont take PAL into account? (subtract the pitch of both notes. TODO: PAL.)
- MATTT
/ Linux: Black text on dark BG, can I do anything?
- NSF import: frames per notes is always wrong, smaller number should be note size.

Testing:
- WAV export: MERGE+RETEST WITH SAMPLE RATE!
- Retest snapping with various pattern sizes.

2.1.0 Trailer
=============
- Linux port
- Improved WAV export
- FamiTone2 SFX export
- Command-line interface
- Note snapping
- Trackpad controls
- MacOS+Linux MIDI keyboard support
- Pasting of text values in envelopes
- Import of instruments from anything
- New timecode mode
- Mix paste
- Duplicate patterns.
- *** PAL space authoring.

Tweet ideas
===========
- Tweet the linux screenshots, find a dev who wants to help.
- Tips of the week or something, animated GIFs.

MaxWar wish list.
=================
- Copy patterns to other channels.
- Option for no-sound when no-pattern?
- Loop end point
- MIDI import/export.
	
Linux notes
===========
- When slow startup in VM : dbus-launch --exit-with-session mono FamiStudio.exe
- GTK# : sudo apt-get install gtk-sharp2 
	- This seem to be enough (sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-cil)
- How to recompile with old linux:
	- Ubuntu 16.04.6
	- Install cmake-gui
	- OpenAL Soft
		- Install ALSA libs (libasound2-dev)
		- Download openal-soft code
		- Run cmake-gui in /build folder.
		- Configure
		- Choose static C + C++ libs
		- Choose Release (no debug info)
		- Generate.
		- make!
	- NesSndEmu + NotSoFatso, run script.
	- RtMidi, need to add static C/C++ libs to cmake file.

Backlog:
=========
- P1: Feature request from GitHub: Snap to 1/2, 1/4, etc.
- P1: Fix crash on startup when there are no audio device (also freeze when switching audio devices)
- P1: Proper error messages when something fails (save, etc.)
- P2: Raw FDS modulation table envelope.
- P2: Rendering of note is sub-optimal, BG + lines + attack, etc. D2D batches if same shader.
- P2: Instrument folders
- P2: Sign exe/setup on Windows (EV cert is too expensive) + Sign/notarize on MacOS (dont want to pay for developper ID).
- P2: Mac: Paste special: Text is super dark
- P2: Mac: Clicking on FS without the window doesn't give it focus...?
- P2: Installer on Japanese machine?
- Note snapping. (or snap automatically when frames arent visible???)
