Version 1.2:
- All notes
	- Fix noise
	- Fix DPCM samples
	- Fix Envelope editing
	- Make sure FT2 stock still works.
- Volume track, do it with a LUT
- Verify that doug's encoding matches what I see in FT2.
- Look at list of features from FT3/4/5 (nesdoug), see which ones would be interesting (see how much it differs from stock FT2).
- Add "kernel" debug option to NSF export to test FT2 vs. FT2Ex.
- Release envelopes (see how envelopes are stored in FT2)
x Improve NSF DPCM (add offset from C000).
x Tempo bug from GitHub.
x Unify notes freq from ASM and C#
- MIDI improvements.
- PAL support

Backlog:
- VRC6, FDS, etc.
- Fix crash on startup when there are no audio device 
- Proper error messages when soemthing fails (save, etc.)
- Add taskbar progress bar + color to show playback state
- Mono port (need help)
- High DPI support.
- Copy-paste support for notes/effects.
- Refactor UI draw code, split in small functions.
- Freeze on some atom processors?

Extending the range of notes supported. 
This is similar to what nesdoug did in FT3. Also taking the note tables from FamiTracker so that nobody complains the pitch isnt exactly the same.
