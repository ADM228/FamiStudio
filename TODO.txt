2.2.0 Trailer
=============
1) Recording mode 
	- TODO: Insert of MIDI keyboard
	
	- Tired of clicking with the mouse? Input notes using a MIDI controller or a QWERTY keyboard. 
	- Patterns are automatically created as needed.
	- The snapping precision is used to control the length of each recorded notes.
	- Press Backspace to go back, Tab to skip ahead and 1 to insert a stop note. 
	- QWERTY keys are displayed on the piano, Page Up/Page Down to move the octave up/down. [Show QWERTY layout]
2) Arpeggios:
	- Define your own arpeggios of arbitrary length and complexity.
	- Unlike instrument arpeggio envelopes, these arpeggios are not bound to any specific instrument.
	- They will appear as semi-transparent chords in the piano roll.
3) Sound Engine
	- [Go back to Silver Surfer playing]
	- [Open MESEN to show demo, timed with the song playing]
	- [Open Export dialog, go to FamiStudio export section]
	
	- First official release of the FamiStudio Sound Engine for NES developers.
	- Supports every feature supported by FamiStudio, available for all 3 major assemblers : CA65, NESASM and ASM6.
	- Export to it through the Export dialog or the command line.
4) Discord server!
	- Come discuss with other FamiStudio users. Link available on www.famistudio.org. 
5) FDS Disk Export
	- You can now export your Famicom Disk System song to FDS files to play them on actual hardware.
	- Here it is using a FDSStick to avoid having to deal with physical disks, but the actual FDS sound hardware is being used.

Linux notes
===========
- When slow startup in VM : dbus-launch --exit-with-session mono FamiStudio.exe
- GTK# : sudo apt-get install gtk-sharp2 
	- This seem to be enough (sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-cil)
- How to recompile with old linux:
	- Ubuntu 16.04.6
	- Install cmake-gui
	- OpenAL Soft
		- Install ALSA libs (libasound2-dev)
		- Download openal-soft code
		- Run cmake-gui in /build folder.
		- Configure
		- Choose static C + C++ libs
		- Choose Release (no debug info)
		- Generate.
		- make!
	- NesSndEmu + NotSoFatso, run script.
	- RtMidi, need to add static C/C++ libs to cmake file.

Backlog:
=========
- Drag seek bar
- Instrument picker
- Raw FDS modulation table envelope.
- Rendering of note is sub-optimal, BG + lines + attack, etc. D2D batches if same shader.
- Instrument folders
- Sign exe/setup on Windows (EV cert is too expensive) + Sign/notarize on MacOS (dont want to pay for developper ID).
- Mac: Paste special: Text is super dark
- Mac: Clicking on FS without the window doesn't give it focus...?
- Installer on Japanese machine?
- FamiTracker tempo mode never plays the 1st frame in the NSF.
