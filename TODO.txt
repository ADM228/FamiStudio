1.5.0: All expansions + PAL
============================
- OPERATION TEMPO/PAL NSF:

	- Expansions: 
		- Do they need tempo mode? Just export at speed 1, tempo 150. No speed change.
	- Non-expansions:
		- PAL/NTSC/Dual + 2 tempo modes = 6

	- FamiStudio Tempo
		- Intead of 307/256, notelength + pal skip pattern (3 bytes + 1 empty)
		- Tempo logic
		- Reuse speed change code + 3 bytes.
		
	- What about when exporting to FamiTone2? Add a variant field.

- PAL support/tempo/speed:
	- Copy paste between differente tempos?
	- NSF (#defines)
	- Import/export formats.
	- FT2 FS tempo version. (Rename Famitone2FS ==> FamiStudio).

- All expansions.
	- Import/export all formats: slides.
- When a mismatching channel is selected (expansions VS. none), pick first one. Less frustrating.
- MATTT.
- BUG: Once I hit a bug where i could drag notes without clicking on them???

TESTING:
========
- Test installer on Japanese machine.
- FamiTracker import/export, retest Text, slides, etc. 
- Retest slide notes, etc. Everything that crosses boundary, with various pattern sizes, etc.
- FTM, test a lot. Needs to match text import (export to text and compare).
- MAC: 
	- Make sure namco channels dialog works. Added Combo box prop change callback.
	- Make sure instrument properties window pops UP when Y > 1/2 height
	- New functions to update some controls.
	- Export dialog label sizes.
	- ValidateDelegate
	- 0.5 pixel offset for pattern bitmaps.
- Binary FTM import. Try opening all the demo songs from FT.
x Duty cycle envelopes, make sure all import/export format support it.
- Fix saw in Shovel knight.
- Retest smooth vibrato on/off.
- Make sure that when there is no loop point, NSF stops.
- Test long pattern > 256 a lot. 
- Test split of pattern longer than default.
- Test change active channel (press 1...5) while a transaction is happening.
- Test everything about note dragging, edge cases, interrupt while dragging, end of song, etc....

Breaking changes
================
- VRC6 saw duty (mention in FamiTracker compatibility section)

1.5.0 Trailer

Backlog:
=========
- P1: Fix crash on startup when there are no audio device (also freeze when switching audio devices)
- P1: Proper error messages when something fails (save, etc.)
- P1: Command line processing
- P2: Add taskbar progress bar + color to show playback state
- P2: Raw FDS modulation table envelope.
- P2: Rendering of note is sub-optimal, BG + lines + attack, etc. D2D batches if same shader.
- P2: Instrument folders
- P2: Sign exe/setup on Windows (EV cert is too expensive) + Sign/notarize on MacOS (dont want to pay for developper ID).
