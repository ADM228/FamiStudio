Tips & Tricks
=============
x #00 - Basic controls & onboarding (pan, zoom, trackpad, tooltips, piano roll view rect, demo songs)
x #01 - Sequencer basics (pattern add, delete, edit, instance & copy).
x #02 - Piano roll basics (add note, delete note, snapping, dragging, select, transpose with KB).
x #03 - Channels in piano roll (force display, muting & soloing, etc.)
#04 - Volume envelopes & release notes
#05 - Toggling note attacks (combination with release)
#06 - Slide notes (combination with release notes)
#07 - Pitch envelopes (absolute & relative, paste text values)
#08 - Effect panel (speed, FDS mod, etc.)
#09 - Quickly copy notes
#10 - Copy & paste (special paste, mix paste, drag & copy, between projects, etc.)
#11 - Custom pattern settings & loop points.
#12 - Recording with Keyboard or MIDI controller (page up/down, keys, etc.)
#13 - Importing instruments
#14 - Importing from FamiTracker
#15 - Importing NSFs (bit reverse, etc.)
#16 - FamiStudio vs. FamiTracker tempo (PAL, etc.)
#17 - DPCM samples (import, save, etc)
#18 - Replacing an instrument by another (copy envelopes, etc.)
#19 - Arpeggios (replacing, etc.)
#20 - Exporting to FamiTracker
#21 - Exporting to a NSF / ROM / FDS Disk
#22 - FDS audio (waveform, modulation, etc.)
#23 - VRC7 audio (release envelope)
#24 - N163 audio (wavetable, number of channels => quality, etc.)
#25 - Command line processing 

2.3.0
=====
- Enhanced FamiTracker compatibility.
	- Delayed notes
	- Delayed cuts
	- Vxx
	- Tempo changes.
- Song merge (+ fix instrument import... very bad). 
	=> Add unique ID validation.
- Dont change scroll in pianoroll/sequencer when undoing + playing + follow to avoid jumps
- Labels on notes in piano roll.
- Warning when +16KB on samples on FTM.
- Copy patterns to other channels.
- Save as MP3

2.2.0 Release
=============
- Update NESDEV wiki.

MaxWar wish list.
=================
- Option for no-sound when no-pattern?
- Loop end point
- MIDI import/export.
	
Linux notes
===========
- When slow startup in VM : dbus-launch --exit-with-session mono FamiStudio.exe
- GTK# : sudo apt-get install gtk-sharp2 
	- This seem to be enough (sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-cil)
- How to recompile with old linux:
	- Ubuntu 16.04.6
	- Install cmake-gui
	- OpenAL Soft
		- Install ALSA libs (libasound2-dev)
		- Download openal-soft code
		- Run cmake-gui in /build folder.
		- Configure
		- Choose static C + C++ libs
		- Choose Release (no debug info)
		- Generate.
		- make!
	- NesSndEmu + NotSoFatso, run script.
	- RtMidi, need to add static C/C++ libs to cmake file.

MkDocs
======
- Install Python
- pip install mkdocs
- pip install mkdocs-bootswatch

Backlog:
=========
- Drag seek bar
- Instrument picker
- Raw FDS modulation table envelope.
- Rendering of note is sub-optimal, BG + lines + attack, etc. D2D batches if same shader.
- Instrument folders
- Sign exe/setup on Windows (EV cert is too expensive) + Sign/notarize on MacOS (dont want to pay for developper ID).
- Mac: Paste special: Text is super dark
- Mac: Clicking on FS without the window doesn't give it focus...?
- Installer on Japanese machine?
- FamiTracker tempo mode never plays the 1st frame in the NSF.
