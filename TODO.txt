FamiStudio Tempo 2.0
====================
- Derisk slide with 3-4-3-3 for example
- Song settings, BPM + groove calculation
- Render min(groove)
- Prototype playback
- PAL playback.
- Function for insert blank notes for export.
- Improve resize, make it clearer what it will do (move grid, resize notes, etc.)
- How do we specify time signature? (pre-fl studio 20 like?)

Questions:
- Are tempo envelope always aligned (2,3,4,8) ? => They reset every pattern. *** TEST THAT.
- Configurable groove? 3-4-3-3, 3-3-4-3, etc. => YES, not too many.

FamiStudio 2.5.0
================
/ Low-pass filter in DPCM sample editor. (not sure.) Hot reload instead?
	- Caps in name "Low pass filter"
	- Or save source data location + hot reload?
	- Cap filter length for perf.
- Loop prevention for envelope (brad issue).
- Note refactor: (2.6.0?)
	- Whole note drag, or FULL NOT REFACTOR.
	- When using 1/2 snapping, dragging notes is awkward. (will depend on tempo solution).

=============

- MAYBE: MIDI in/out (not sure... non-technical people will be disapointed)
- QWERTZ?
	- GTK colors. => Doesnt work on mac...
	- Test mac with weird keyboards.
	- If a key is a music key, should we not process it (1-5 changes channel, so playing a note changes the channel...).
- studX:
	- Song sorting from FTM.
	- Reverse 2xx effect??

Testing
=======
- MacOS : Scaling, etc. Find someone with a mac to test. Look at CPU usage.
- MacOS : "Whenever I minimize it tho, you can't open it back up by clicking on the icon. You have to right click it and click 'Show All Windows', then click the window there.". how2bboss.
- Linux : Test scaling more.
- OGL : Grey screen happens sometimes.

Linux notes
===========
- When slow startup in VM : dbus-launch --exit-with-session mono FamiStudio.exe
- GTK# : sudo apt-get install gtk-sharp2 
	- This seem to be enough (sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-cil)
- How to recompile with old linux:
	- Ubuntu 16.04.6
	- Install cmake-gui
	- OpenAL Soft
		- Install ALSA libs (libasound2-dev)
		- Download openal-soft code
		- Run cmake-gui in /build folder.
		- Configure
		- Choose static C + C++ libs
		- Choose Release (no debug info)
		- Generate.
		- make!
	- NesSndEmu + NotSoFatso, run script.
	- RtMidi, need to add static C/C++ libs to cmake file.

Backlog:
=========
- Raw FDS modulation table envelope.
- Rendering of note is sub-optimal, BG + lines + attack, etc. D2D batches if same shader.
- Instrument folders + collapse entire sections (samples, arps, etc.)
- Sign exe/setup on Windows (EV cert is too expensive) + Sign/notarize on MacOS (dont want to pay for developper ID).
- Mac: Paste special: Text is super dark
- Mac: Clicking on FS without the window doesn't give it focus...?
- Installer on Japanese machine?
- Keyboard recording VS. non-QWERTY keyboards.
- BUG: After cleanup, selected arpeggio + instrument seems wrong. (added notes make arpeggion sound, but none selected.)
- Highlight piano keys when they are pressed with QWERTY or MIDI. (LOW PRIO)
