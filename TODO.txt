1.5.0: FDS + PAL
================
- FDS:
	- Project explorer advanced instrument params (move relative pitch env there).
	- FDS Wave cant be negative
	- Values above 61 are not visible.
	- Presets (saw, triangle, sine, square, etc.)
	- Proper playback (remove hacks)
	- NSF.
	- FamiTracker import/export
- Fine pitch track
	- NSF
	- FamiTracker import/export
- PAL support/tempo/speed:
	- 2 tempo modes:
		- FamiTracker : Tracker like, tempo/speed, delayed notes/cuts. Minimal effor to support.
		- FamiStudio  : Always 1 note = frame. Note size, PAL repetition pattern. (TEST THAT!)
	- Do it in FamiStudio.
	- Fix rounding on weird tempos.
	- Delayed notes/cuts.
	- NSF (#defines)
	- Add better tempo logic to famitone2fs.
- Duty cycle envelopes.
- ROM export (Mapper 31):
	- Song change + controls (Need gamepad fix to prevent DPCM interference).
- Remove jump and skip effects:
	x Jump is simply a loop point
	- Skip is a shorter pattern.
		- FamiTracker import/export (should we only support SHORTER patterns??? YES!)
		- FamiTone split, etc.
		- Retest slide notes, etc. Everything that crosses boundary, with various pattern sizes, export to FT, etc.
		- Retest seek
		- We dont update MaxInstanceLength in all cases (song resize, change pattern length, etc.)
		- Handle where we change the song pattern.
		- Truncate pattern to their maxlength.
		- Make dark version of seq header icon.
- BUG: Toggle attack that crosses pattern boundary probably doesnt work.
- Bar length -> Measure length

========================

Backlog:
- Raw FDS modulation table envelope.
- Instrument folders
- All expansions.
- NSF import(would needse? We can create multiple instruments for duty).
- Cleanup (merge duplicated patterns, instruments, r fine pitch track, anything elemove unused stuff.
- Fix crash on startup when there are no audio device 
- Proper error messages when something fails (save, etc.)
- Add taskbar progress bar + color to show playback state
- Sign exe/setup on Windows (EV cert is too expensive) + Sign/notarize on MacOS (dont want to pay for developper ID).
- Rendering of note is sub-optimal, BG + lines + attack, etc. D2D batches if same shader.
