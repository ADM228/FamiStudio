1.4.0: VRC6 + Slides
====================
NOW:
- Make sure Shovel sounds legit (intro especially)

Polish:
- Has it gotten slower? Take RenderDoc capture to be sure we arent drawing crazy stuff.

Testing:
- Piano roll, selection, etc. Delete stuff, make sur FX and everything is consitent.
- Retest copy paste a lot...
- Note drawing, release, stop, from far away.
- Reset everywhere i changed to note.Clear();

Trailer (~1 min) (TODO: Need to figure out what to show, need callouts)
================
- 00:00
	- FamiStudio 1.4.0  [Shovel knight footage]
	- All audio recorded live from FamiStudio. 
	- Although not an NES game, the entire Shovel Knight soundtrack was done in FamiTracker and uses it. 
	- Arguably some of the best chiptune ever made.
- 00:11 
	- First audio expansion: Konami VRC6! Give you 2 extra square channels and a sawtooth channel. [Zoom on sequencer]
	- Enabled in the project settings. [Open project settings + zoom]
- 00:20
	- Slide notes!
	- Simply hold S and drag up or down! [Show how it works]
	- Starts a the note pitch and reaches the target pitch by the end of the note. [Callout]
	- Will convert from/to 1xx/2xx/3xx/Qxx/Rxx when importing/exporting from FamiTracker.
- 00:30?:
	- Option to remove attack on notes
	- The little black rectangle on notes now represent the attack.
	- Hold A and click on a note to remove the attack [Show how it works]
	- This will prevent the envelopes from restarting when a new note comes it.
- 00:35?:
	- Vibrato effect add vibrato without having to use a pitch envelope. [Open FX panel, change a value]
	- Will convert from/to 4xy when importing/exporting to FamiTracker.
- 00:40:
	- Combining slide notes, no-attack notes, release notes and vibrato can create some very expressive melodies [Solo melody on an interesting part]
- 00:45:
	- Smooth vibrato:
	- New option to work around a NES hardware bug where vibrato on the square channel will "click" around notes B0,D1,F1,A1,D2,A2 and A3 (NTSC).
	- Based on the clever "smooth vibrato" trick by Blargg. Will work on actual hardware.
- 00:55?
	- Listen to this sick bass line! [Pattern time 23, solo bass + drum]
- 01:00
	- As usual, most of these new features will import/export to FamiTracker via the TXT format [Show, play song in FamiTracker, show Qxx + 4xx]

Sound up! FamiStudio 1.4.0 is out! VRC6, slide notes, vibrato effect and so much more! @virtjk @YachtClubGames

1.5.0: FDS + PAL
================
- Delayed cut + delayed note. This will allow us to to song without time = 1
	- Delayed note delays the whole row, not just the note. Which is good i guess, it makes it behave like a real not at a tick level.
	- What happens if you have a note at the 6th frame when running on PAL (which only has 5)???
x FDS support in NesSndEmu 
- FDS "envelope" in piano roll.
- Project explorer advanced instrument params (move relative pitch env there).
- Instrument folders
- PAL support

========================

Backlog:
- Cleanup (merge duplicated patterns, instruments, remove unused stuff.
- Fix crash on startup when there are no audio device 
- Proper error messages when something fails (save, etc.)
- Add taskbar progress bar + color to show playback state
- Sign exe/setup on Windows (EV cert is too expensive) + Sign/notarize on MacOS (dont want to pay for developper ID).
