2.2.0
=====
- Play right now when dragging...
- BUG: Select notes with arpeggio, do CTRL+LEFT/RIGHT to move them. Arpeggion is gone.
- BUG: Copy paste doesnt copy arpeggio.
- BUG: Select expansions instrument, change expansions, will delete the exp instruments, old instrument still referenced and can draw in track.
	- Also, if an arpeggio was selected, gets confused. Audio still plays arpeggio, but does not add to piano roll.
- Piano roll left auto scroll when drag is annoying. Make it only when going over the piano.
- Loop count on wav.
- FamiStudio sound engine
	- Nice test ROM (same as ROM, but with SFX player)
		- Update in NMI?
		- Song1: Shatterhand
		+ Song2: Silver surfer once done.
		- Use punch out! SFX. 71 + something else.
		- Select plays a DPCM (just a test)
	- Re-test SFX
	- Documentation.
	- Export dialog + command line.
	- Double check TAB/SPACE at the end.
- Arpeggio : GOAL, recreate song #4 from silver surfer. (3/4 notes, slow/fast, Micromachines & Jurassic park has 1 frame delay before starting the arp)
	- NSF
		- Test expansions.
	- Import export (FT, text format)
	- Copy paste doesnt work.
	- Validation code.
	- Paste special
	x Replace selection arp
	x Add/remove arps.
	- Must delete + add note to set the arp, weird?
	- Should I use a "..." icon for arps?
/ Show piano roll rect in sequencer
	x Make it a setting
	- Make it look better.
- Drag seek bar (github issue request!).
- Instrument picker?
- Discord server
- Feature requests from email (record?)
- Linux, rename .so -> lib***.so

Testing:
========
- Retest ROM export.
- Test tutorial dialog with high DPI : mac + windows
- Deprecate FamiTone2 FS.
- One bad pixel in ROM, make sure its gone.

Tweet ideas
===========
- Tweet the linux screenshots, find a dev who wants to help.
- Tips of the week or something, animated GIFs.

MaxWar wish list.
=================
- Copy patterns to other channels.
- Option for no-sound when no-pattern?
- Loop end point
- MIDI import/export.
	
Linux notes
===========
- When slow startup in VM : dbus-launch --exit-with-session mono FamiStudio.exe
- GTK# : sudo apt-get install gtk-sharp2 
	- This seem to be enough (sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-cil)
- How to recompile with old linux:
	- Ubuntu 16.04.6
	- Install cmake-gui
	- OpenAL Soft
		- Install ALSA libs (libasound2-dev)
		- Download openal-soft code
		- Run cmake-gui in /build folder.
		- Configure
		- Choose static C + C++ libs
		- Choose Release (no debug info)
		- Generate.
		- make!
	- NesSndEmu + NotSoFatso, run script.
	- RtMidi, need to add static C/C++ libs to cmake file.

Trailer/scroll
==============
- Stashed in 5beed88a1bc487ec2cbc725b9d749a464e57dece.

Backlog:
=========
- P1: Fix crash on startup when there are no audio device (also freeze when switching audio devices)
- P1: Proper error messages when something fails (save, etc.)
- P2: Raw FDS modulation table envelope.
- P2: Rendering of note is sub-optimal, BG + lines + attack, etc. D2D batches if same shader.
- P2: Instrument folders
- P2: Sign exe/setup on Windows (EV cert is too expensive) + Sign/notarize on MacOS (dont want to pay for developper ID).
- P2: Mac: Paste special: Text is super dark
- P2: Mac: Clicking on FS without the window doesn't give it focus...?
- P2: Installer on Japanese machine?
- P2: FamiTracker tempo mode never plays the 1st frame in the NSF.
