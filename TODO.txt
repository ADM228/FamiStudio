3.2.0
=====

Beta4:
- Fixed oscilloscope showing discontinuities and jittering
- Added a few helpful error messages.
- Maximize button on piano roll now always visible.
- Using pixel density instead of resolution to detect scaling.
- Fixing piano key color when having the DPCM instrument selected and editing envelopes.
- Fixing distorted DPCM when muting/unmuting channel.

TODO:
- Text size in toolbar when using 66% on tablet.

Low Priority:
- ~ key on other keyboards.
- Audio comparison from imagino
- Chroma subsampling settings for android?

Icon notes:
- 66% zoom, start with 128x128 png.

Testing
=======
- BUG : HH:MM:SSS from itch?
- Test project/instrument merge (with expansions).
- Re-test with various scaling (lots of cahnges to everything, zooming, etc.)
- Test without snapping, i tested snapping a lot, but not witout.

Packaging:
==========
x Make sure no android DLL on windows.
x Two songs from mark
/ Make download list vertical on website.
- Doc : List dependencies in doc, list demo songs in doc, mobile tutorial, move installation procedure to its own page.
- Add link to discord in doc
- Thumbnail + desc for tutorial.

New Features in 3.2.0
=====================
Changes:
- Multi-expansion support
- Proper emulation of triangle/noise/DPCM volume interactions
- Android app (free on Play Store)
- Significant graphic optimizations, especially on lower-end machines or large projects.
- Minor quality of life features
- Minor cosmetic UI changes (icons, envelope editor, coloring piano with DPCM colors, etc.)
Behavior changes:
- Snapping precision is now expressed in beats. So with the default settings, 1 means a quarter note.
- Channel volumes have been slightly adjusted to match the NES hardware more closely.

3.3.0
=====
- Poppin issue on FDS? See messages from "JHÄ€KRI" on discord. Change volume on FDS with a blank waveform.
- Option to override DMC initial value on sample mapping
- Fix GTK leak (GTK 3.x?), or 2.12.45
- Register viewer.
- Volume/effect scaling

Features missing from the Mobile version
========================================
- No MIDI import/export
- No NSF import
- No Sound Engine/Famitone 2 export
- No FamiTracker text export
- No FamiStudio text export
- No FamiTracker FTI instrument import
- No DPCM sample import from other projects (WAV/DMC only)
- No DPCM sample data export
- No MIDI controller support

Videos:
=======
- Mobile tutorial? Or just a documentation page with a bunch of GIFs?
- Tutorial for FamiTracker

Linux notes 
=========== 
- When slow startup in VM : dbus-launch --exit-with-session mono FamiStudio.exe 
- GTK# : sudo apt-get install gtk-sharp2  
	- This seem to be enough (sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-cil) 
- How to recompile with old linux: 
	- Ubuntu 16.04.6 
	- Install cmake-gui 
	- OpenAL Soft 
		- Install ALSA libs (libasound2-dev) 
		- Download openal-soft code 
		- Run cmake-gui in /build folder. 
		- Configure 
		- Choose static C + C++ libs 
		- Choose Release (no debug info) 
		- Generate. 
		- make! 
	- OGG:
		- Download ogg/vorbis code
		- cmake-gui, static lib, configure
		- CMakeFiles/vorbis.dir/flags.make, add -fPIC
			C_FLAGS = -O3 -DNDEBUG -fPIC 
		- Same for OGG
	- NesSndEmu + NotSoFatso, run script. 
	- RtMidi, need to add static C/C++ libs to cmake file. 
 
MacOS notes
===========
- MacOS Sierra, fully patched is 10.12.6, with AppKit version 1504.83.101
- Must compile the MacLauncher with this to link to the AppKit version that
  matches GTK+2. This will make MacOS load these older versions afterwards,
  even on more recent OS'es.
- Must compile vorbis on old version too (like Sierra). 
- If problem installing MacOS VM, see @DOUG fix at

	cpuid.0.eax = "0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:1011"
	cpuid.0.ebx = "0111:0101:0110:1110:0110:0101:0100:0111"
	cpuid.0.ecx = "0110:1100:0110:0101:0111:0100:0110:1110"
	cpuid.0.edx = "0100:1001:0110:0101:0110:1110:0110:1001"
	cpuid.1.eax = "0000:0000:0000:0001:0000:0110:0111:0001"
	cpuid.1.ebx = "0000:0010:0000:0001:0000:1000:0000:0000"
	cpuid.1.ecx = "1000:0010:1001:1000:0010:0010:0000:0011"
	cpuid.1.edx = "0000:0111:1000:1011:1111:1011:1111:1111"
- If NAT network doesnt work (problem is only in Monterey right now) do that:
	ethernet0.virtualDev = "vmxnet3"

Backlog: 
=========
- Volume/effect scaling?
- Write delta counter (Zxx).
- More options for oscilloscope (https://github.com/maxim-zhao/SidWizPlus/wiki)

- Overclocking (2x, 3x, 4x would be a good start).
- NSF import read DMC initial value.
- Save snapping + qwerty settings + some export settings.
- Left/right pan with +/- (cubase style)?
- TailWindz : CTRL + Scroll should do "something"
- Hardware sweep (how to not conflict with smooth vibrato?)
- Scales
- Loop prevention for envelope (brad issue). 
- Raw FDS modulation table envelope. 
- Instrument folders + collapse entire sections (samples, arps, etc.)
