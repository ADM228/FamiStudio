Toolbar:
- Reorganize buttons, need to see delete + export. 

Scaling issue:
- Support 3 scalings (Will not affect toolbars)?

2nd piano:
- About 1/4 of the screen
- 2 buttons to go fwd/backward by 1 snap unit (only enabled in rec mode)
- Can pinch to zoom
- How to scroll?
	=> Like musepad, button between black keys?


Misc:
/ Line widths, bias + 2
- WIP file will never appear dirty, use a INI file with info in it?
- Assert when exporting video, seem like the save dialog info gets popped? Or not pushed?
	=> Log dialog overwrites the save. FUCK.
-

3.2.0
=====
- NSF bug tempo from Discord!
- Export intro-only is broken?
- Crash when adding note to last note of pattern #256
- Bring back fonts for 150%...
- Timecode alignment looks like ass now, create a special mode for texture that uses fixed width + center align?
- Convert more icons to white + remove last border (release + loop point.)
- Copy instrument.
- Change insturment dialog for a combo
- Get rid of "None" mode on piano roll.
- Real fix for flatpak videos.

Misc:

DPCM/Tri volume thing (from tromino)
- Run more tests on NES, with more volumes + noise too.
- Add a global 80% volume to match FamiTracker.
- Channels will need to be rebalanced a bit since i bumped the squares.
- Compare with old FamiStudio to see if old project will sound like ass.
	
Misc:
- Mac/Linux : CheckListBox doesnt fire events (needed for Midi import/PAL).
- Mac/Linux : Make sure piano roll maximize layout works, and also that sequencer doesnt render when disabled.
- Remove "None" piano roll mode.
- Make sure OnMouseLeave works on that too.
- Fix GTK single multiple label issue.	

Testing
=======
- Add multi-exp unit test.
- Test project/instrument merge (with expansions).
- Retest with various scaling (lots of cahnges to everything, zooming, etc.)
- Test without snapping, i tested snapping a lot, but not witout.
- Compare instrument colors (seq/piano roll) for all platforms
- Re-test last open file.

Videos:
=======
- Mobile tutorial? Or just a documentation page with a bunch of GIFs?
- Tutorial for FamiTracker

Linux notes 
=========== 
- When slow startup in VM : dbus-launch --exit-with-session mono FamiStudio.exe 
- GTK# : sudo apt-get install gtk-sharp2  
	- This seem to be enough (sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-cil) 
- How to recompile with old linux: 
	- Ubuntu 16.04.6 
	- Install cmake-gui 
	- OpenAL Soft 
		- Install ALSA libs (libasound2-dev) 
		- Download openal-soft code 
		- Run cmake-gui in /build folder. 
		- Configure 
		- Choose static C + C++ libs 
		- Choose Release (no debug info) 
		- Generate. 
		- make! 
	- OGG:
		- Download ogg/vorbis code
		- cmake-gui, static lib, configure
		- CMakeFiles/vorbis.dir/flags.make, add -fPIC
			C_FLAGS = -O3 -DNDEBUG -fPIC 
		- Same for OGG
	- NesSndEmu + NotSoFatso, run script. 
	- RtMidi, need to add static C/C++ libs to cmake file. 
 
MacOS notes
===========
- MacOS Sierra, fully patched is 10.12.6, with AppKit version 1504.83.101
- Must compile the MacLauncher with this to link to the AppKit version that
  matches GTK+2. This will make MacOS load these older versions afterwards,
  even on more recent OS'es.
- Must compile vorbis on old version too (like Sierra). 
- If problem installing MacOS VM, see @DOUG fix at
  https://www.geekrar.com/how-to-fix-the-cpu-has-been-disabled-by-the-guest-os/
	cpuid.0.eax = "0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:1011"
	cpuid.0.ebx = "0111:0101:0110:1110:0110:0101:0100:0111"
	cpuid.0.ecx = "0110:1100:0110:0101:0111:0100:0110:1110"
	cpuid.0.edx = "0100:1001:0110:0101:0110:1110:0110:1001"
	cpuid.1.eax = "0000:0000:0000:0001:0000:0110:0111:0001"
	cpuid.1.ebx = "0000:0010:0000:0001:0000:1000:0000:0000"
	cpuid.1.ecx = "1000:0010:1001:1000:0010:0010:0000:0011"
	cpuid.1.edx = "0000:0111:1000:1011:1111:1011:1111:1111"
- If NAT network doesnt work (problem is only in Monterey right now) do that:
	ethernet0.virtualDev = "vmxnet3"

MkDocs 
====== 
- Install Python 
- pip install mkdocs 
- pip install mkdocs-bootswatch

3.2.0
=====
- Overclocking (2x, 3x, 4x would be a good start).
- Multi-expansions (dont want that garbage in the sound engine, would need to be a seperate NSF thing).

Backlog: 
=========
- NSF import read DMC initial value.
- Volume/effect scaling?
- Save snapping + qwerty settings + some export settings.
- Left/right pan with +/- (cubase style)?
- TailWindz : CTRL + Scroll should do "something"
- Hardware sweep (how to not conflict with smooth vibrato?)
- Write delta counter (Zxx).
- Scales
- Loop prevention for envelope (brad issue). 
- Raw FDS modulation table envelope. 
- Instrument folders + collapse entire sections (samples, arps, etc.) 
- Sign exe/setup on Windows (EV cert is too expensive) + Sign/notarize on MacOS (dont want to pay for developper ID). 
- Installer on Japanese machine? 
- Square selection: Sort-of works, but problems are with stop notes. To know if a stop note is in the square
  you need the previous note, but that note may just have been deleted (like in DeleteNotes), so its almost
  impossible to do without caching the stop note values.
