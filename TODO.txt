2.1.0
=====
- Friday:
	x 2.0.3 HOT FIX!
	- Look at MaxWar wish list.
		- Better folder handling
		- Copy patterns instead of instancing? How.
		x Import FamiStudio isntruments
		- Std time
		- MIDI?
	- Copy paste of text values in envelopes.
		=> Try to use real clipboard on Mac.
	- Trackpad controls
		- Send test builds.
		- Disable on Linux? Not good enough.
		- Alt control for zooming.
		- Review scrolling direction on all platforms.

- Note snapping. (or snap automatically when frames arent visible???)
	x Icons
	- Piano roll UI
	- Snapping.
- Paste-mix (NyxTheShield).
- One more sound engine? Plenty?
- Slides in NSF dont take PAL into account? (subtract the pitch of both notes. TODO: PAL.)
/ Linux: Black text on dark BG, can I do anything?

Tweet ideas
===========
- Tweet the linux screenshots, find a dev who wants to help.
- Tips of the week or something, animated GIFs.

Linux notes
===========
- When slow startup in VM : dbus-launch --exit-with-session mono FamiStudio.exe
- GTK# : sudo apt-get install gtk-sharp2 
	- This seem to be enough (sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-cil)
- How to recompile with old linux:
	- Ubuntu 16.04.6
	- Install cmake-gui
	- OpenAL Soft
		- Install ALSA libs (libasound2-dev)
		- Download openal-soft code
		- Run cmake-gui in /build folder.
		- Configure
		- Choose static C + C++ libs
		- Choose Release (no debug info)
		- Generate.
		- make!
	- NesSndEmu + NotSoFatso, run script.
	- RtMidi, need to add static C/C++ libs to cmake file.

Backlog:
=========
- P1: Feature request from GitHub: Snap to 1/2, 1/4, etc.
- P1: Fix crash on startup when there are no audio device (also freeze when switching audio devices)
- P1: Proper error messages when something fails (save, etc.)
- P2: Raw FDS modulation table envelope.
- P2: Rendering of note is sub-optimal, BG + lines + attack, etc. D2D batches if same shader.
- P2: Instrument folders
- P2: Sign exe/setup on Windows (EV cert is too expensive) + Sign/notarize on MacOS (dont want to pay for developper ID).
- P2: Mac: Paste special: Text is super dark
- P2: Mac: Clicking on FS without the window doesn't give it focus...?
- P2: Installer on Japanese machine?
