1.5.0: FDS + PAL
================
- FDS:
	- Project explorer advanced instrument params (move relative pitch env there).
- Duty cycle envelopes.
- Fine pitch track
- PAL support/tempo/speed:
	- PAL/NTSC button in toolbar
	- Switch note table
	- Test frame repetition. 
	
	NEW PLAN: 2 tempo modes:
		- FamiTracker : Tracker like, tempo/speed, delayed notes/cuts. Minimal effor to support.
		- FamiStudio  : Always 1 note = frame. Note size, PAL repetition pattern. (TEST THAT!)
- ROM export (Mapper 31):
	- Song change + controls (Need gamepad fix to prevent DPCM interference).
- Remove jump and skip effects:
	- Jump is simply a loop point
	- Skip is a shorter pattern.


========================

Backlog:
- Raw FDS modulation table envelope.
- Instrument folders
- All expansions.
- NSF import(would need fine pitch track, anything else? We can create multiple instruments for duty).
- Cleanup (merge duplicated patterns, instruments, remove unused stuff.
- Fix crash on startup when there are no audio device 
- Proper error messages when something fails (save, etc.)
- Add taskbar progress bar + color to show playback state
- Sign exe/setup on Windows (EV cert is too expensive) + Sign/notarize on MacOS (dont want to pay for developper ID).
- Rendering of note is sub-optimal, BG + lines + attack, etc. D2D batches if same shader.
