4.2.0 Brainstorm
=================
x Upgrade Windows to .NET 7.0
	- Test MacOS startup script.
/ Switch to .NET for Android too.
	x Test debug/release 
	- Setup keystore, etc.
	- Bring back APK
/ Instrument folders + collapse entire sections (samples, arps, etc.) 
	- Make it work on mobile.
/ Video export improvements:
	- Test/Make it work on mobile.
/ Latency improvements:
	- Android : Run short/1-frame tests.
	- MacOS : Audio device detection change.
/ Hold SHIFT+click (also double-click) for multiple delete.	
	- Make it work on mobile.
/ Mixer improvements
	- Make it work on mobile.
- Is export setting DPI scaling at 100% when exporting, does it affect the whole UI? (https://discord.com/channels/747649221879922840/747649222354010173/1185063833266561104)
	=> MacOS only, GLFWToWindow() uses DpiScaling.Window.
- Allow changing vibrato depth without resetting (vibrato speed will still reset for the time being)
	- Dont compress vibrato envelopes.
	- New opcode "override envelope and reset", call only when speed changes.
- Size option for mobile piano
- Make MacOS icons respect 10% border (https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/icons)
- Android media player notification option
- Sequencer copy/paste : we dont copy custom pattern settings if selection is empty.
- Kawashin N163 comparison with NSFPLAY, listen to Wave 1 isolated. (https://discord.com/channels/@me/1093046594062004286/1183464431674470570)
x Make sure attack refactor didnt affect how overriden stuff works (ex: arp, then new note without, or vibrato), may need to re-set instrument
/ Finish phase reset
	- NesSndEmu : Fix VRC6 square/saw emulation.
	- NesSndEmu : Check FDS emulation code. There is a big comment explaining the situation.
	- NesSndEmu : FDS/N163, review our use of "delay", a bit sketchy.
	- Add "Accurate Seek" to config dialog too.
- BUG : Why does Mesen play NSF ~0.3% to ~0.4% faster than us? Export a wav and compare. Affects both ROM and NSF.
- BUG : Mouse over project explorer envelope buttons is offset.
	- Also, look at tabs in project explorer (EPSM), they have a padding on left, but not on right.
- S5B Envelope
	- Check volume, seems square is very low with low values, might be normal.
	- Do EPSM version too => Wait on Perkka to free 2 bytes in instrument header.
	- Test disable attack (C# + AMS), shouldnt reset envelope.
	- Make sure manual period on an inactive channel behaves the same on ASM/C#
	- Add to famistudio text.
- Add a way to type in FX + param values, even if its janky...
- Logarithmic FX values.

4.2.0 Testing/Packaging
=======================
- Test all project explorer buttons with folders. Make sure no offsets.
- Undo acciental changes to demo songs (shovel, JTS, etc.)
- Make sure PortAudio.dll is included in portable + setup.
- Compare FDS filter with my FDS once im back home. See how close we can get without adding a dedicated filter.
- Add new features to unit tests
- Run huge sound engine test with old songs.
- Dont publish for chromebooks

4.2.0 Change Log
===========================
- Changes:
	* Folders in Project Explorer
	* Video export improvements : unified piano roll, 3D effect, register overlay & preview mode (desktop only)
	* Reduced audio latency on all platform and switch to WASAPI on Windows
	* More filtering options for audio expansions
	* S5B envelope support (S5B & EPSM)
	* FDS auto-modulation support
	* Phase reset support
	* Accurate seek support (fully emulate entire song from start)
	* Allow disabling attack on notes if all instrument envelopes matches (useful for FM channels)
	* Support for up to 256 instruments (for both regular and expansion) in sound engine
	* Many other small quality of life improvements (eraser mode, copy samples, etc......... LIST MORE HERE!)
	* Upgraded to .NET 7.0
	* Minimum OpenGL requirement lowered to OpenGL 3.0 (was 3.3)
-Breaking/Behavior changes:
	* FDS mod speed/depth effects will be resetted to the instrument values on notes with an attack.

Later
=====
- Borrow TNS-HFC3 from forple in sept/oct.

dotnet publish
==============
- dotnet publish /p:Configuration=Release /p:Platform="x64" ../FamiStudio/FamiStudio.csproj -r win-x64 -c Release -f net5.0 --self-contained
- Copies all the runtime with the build, kind of weird.

Android SDK 12
==============
- Java path : C:\Program Files\Microsoft\jdk-11.0.12.7-hotspot

Linux notes 
=========== 
- When slow startup in VM : dbus-launch --exit-with-session mono FamiStudio.exe 
- How to recompile with old linux: 
	- Ubuntu 16.04.6 
	- Install cmake-gui 
	- OpenAL Soft 
		- Install ALSA libs (libasound2-dev) 
		- Download openal-soft code 
		- Run cmake-gui in /build folder. 
		- Configure 
		- Choose static C + C++ libs 
		- Choose Release (no debug info) 
		- Generate. 
		- make! 
	- OGG:
		- Download ogg/vorbis code
		- cmake-gui, static lib, configure
		- CMakeFiles/vorbis.dir/flags.make, add -fPIC
			C_FLAGS = -O3 -DNDEBUG -fPIC 
		- Same for OGG
	- NesSndEmu + NotSoFatso, run script. 
	- RtMidi, need to add static C/C++ libs to cmake file. 
 
MacOS notes
===========
- MacOS Sierra, fully patched is 10.12.6, with AppKit version 1504.83.101
- Must compile vorbis on old version too (like Sierra). 
- If problem installing MacOS VM, see @DOUG fix at

- Can we keep undo/redo buttons on screen to 1280px? Like hide metronome, etc.
- A way to view the preview effect value (grey rectangle). Either draw it on the left edge, or in the piano roll tolltip.

- Bug import N163 instruments
	https://discord.com/channels/@me/819772561940152321/1154660603617607741
- Low slide notes going down + arp going up = glitch. Fix idea : Internally modify the arp to make it less strong based on slide range (ex: div by 4 if doing down 2 octaves).

- Android encoder bitrate is messed up.
- When multiple VRC7 instrument all use patch 0 at same time (like on first note), they all upload it. Its stupid. Only the first one should, or something like that.
- OSC trigger assert 
- Option to keep unused samples when exporting to sound engine. 
	=> Shelved, will need more work.
- How to add to the "open with" list on Android.
- Better autosave names?
- Delete instruments resets play head.
- Export DMC samples on Mobile.
- Option to set snapping auto depending on last resize.
- "Read only" N163 instrument. Just specify RAM position + size. Other instruments will do the writing.
- NSF import issue TF74
- FDS oscilloscope can assert if you use modulation table to produce very low sound.
- Fix "SeparateChannelsExportTndMode"
- Dual APU (VT02) support? Mesen doesnt support it, fuck it. 
- S5B is 1 octave off. Periods are 12 bits, so technically can do lower, but we still bottom at A0???
- Shy mode on mobile?
- BUG : Quit menu does nothing on MacOS
- Weird shift when using an external display with different scaling (ex: 100% vs 150%)
- Add effect to select N163 wave. How does it react in FT.
- Full range volume for expansions?
- Different aspect ratios for video export? Somebody asked for square
- Improve linux file dialog (Steo feedback)
- Idea from perkka "When an instrument is selected. Have the channels thats not supported by it slightly faded out, or the channel names that support it in bold or something"
- Do a pass on tooltips for ParamProviders.
- Left resize to preserve release position?
- Display number of selected channels in grid for video export?
- BUG : Drag single pattern (with one note covring the entire pattern) from 1 channel to the other while its playing, the old note keeps playing and adds on top.
- BUG : "theres a bug where when you select a pattern multiple times and you try to change a note, the change is multiplied by the # of patterns you selected", see video.
- Reorder channels for video export.
- Overclocking (2x, 3x, 4x would be a good start).
- Hardware sweep (how to not conflict with smooth vibrato?)
- Scales
- Raw FDS modulation table envelope. 
- Sound output selection?
- Give better names to auto saves
- Android : Starting scroll on a slider (in vrc7 instrument) changes the value. How to fix???
- Cleanup : remove duplicated fx values (ex: same volume applied multiple times)
- Paste special, option to rename patterns.
- Uncompressed envelopes
- CLI only EXE (Linux only).
- C0 is hidden by scroll bars
- Piano roll scale on desktop?
- Poppin issue on FDS? See messages from "JHĀKRI" on discord. Change volume on FDS with a blank waveform.
- Dont reset camera in piano roll when deleting instrument (probably to handle case where you were editing the instrument)
- Length counter support? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fg8B3kiVckY
- Double-click to edit name of instrument
- Way to tell if a pattern has other instances, like highlight all instances when mouse over? 
- Option to remove high-pitch from triangle. Mesen has an option, but that's now what we need. I think how2B wants more filtering. Filtering options per channel type?
