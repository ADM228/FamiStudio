- *** BUG RETINA???
- *** FTM VRC6???


FamiStudio Tempo 2.0
====================
- Finish UI, test a lot! 
	- Is the right groove selected if doing custom settings?
- Add missing tooltips (BPM, note length, etc).
- Any other formats needs fixing?
- Documentation.
- Convert demo songs to new tempo (when file format is frozen).
	- Gimmick
	- Tower
	- Any others?

FamiStudio 3.0.0
================
- MIDI : 
	- Import, dialog, etc.
		- Measures per patterns.
	- Export
		x Select 1 song
		x Map velocity to volume
		x Slide note = pitch bend?
		- Instrument mapping. ?
	- Add message for FamiTracker tempo.
- Note refactor: 
	- Remove fractional snapping. Too awkward.
	- When deleting a note, dont delete certain effects.
- Playback speed (1, 1/2, 1/4 ?)
- Remove low pass, add reload.
- Loop prevention for envelope (brad issue).
- Low-pass config in settings (change layout of equalizer)
- BUG : Assert in video file when exporting a single channel (major chord in sq1).
- CRASH : Quit while billy jean was playing.
	Utils.Swap(ref channelsToRender[editChannel], ref channelsToRender[channelsToRender.Length - 1]);
	editChannel was 5, only 5 channels (0-4)
- CRASH : Multi pattern color edit (square selection) crashes when there are empty patterns.

===============
- CUT! : Groove option for FamiTracker too?
	/ Add option to project (Speed effect, BPM).
	- Show speed/BPM depending 
	- Add to player.
	- When exporting to Famitracker, FT2, bake in DPCM channel
	- Support milliseconds when using BPM.

=============

- MAYBE: MIDI in/out (not sure... non-technical people will be disapointed)
- QWERTZ?
	- GTK colors. => Doesnt work on mac...
	- Test mac with weird keyboards.
	- If a key is a music key, should we not process it (1-5 changes channel, so playing a note changes the channel...).
- studX:
	- Song sorting from FTM.
	- Reverse 2xx effect??

Testing
=======
- MacOS : Scaling, etc. Find someone with a mac to test. Look at CPU usage.
- MacOS : "Whenever I minimize it tho, you can't open it back up by clicking on the icon. You have to right click it and click 'Show All Windows', then click the window there.". how2bboss.
- Linux : Test scaling more.
- Windows : Scaling, 150% and stuff for the warning in dialogs.
- OGL : Grey screen happens sometimes.
- Engine : 
	- Re-test delayed note, @no_ref delayed note fix.
	- Re-test FT2 stock with compression thing vs. 2 notes.
	
Linux notes
===========
- When slow startup in VM : dbus-launch --exit-with-session mono FamiStudio.exe
- GTK# : sudo apt-get install gtk-sharp2 
	- This seem to be enough (sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-cil)
- How to recompile with old linux:
	- Ubuntu 16.04.6
	- Install cmake-gui
	- OpenAL Soft
		- Install ALSA libs (libasound2-dev)
		- Download openal-soft code
		- Run cmake-gui in /build folder.
		- Configure
		- Choose static C + C++ libs
		- Choose Release (no debug info)
		- Generate.
		- make!
	- NesSndEmu + NotSoFatso, run script.
	- RtMidi, need to add static C/C++ libs to cmake file.

Backlog:
=========
- Raw FDS modulation table envelope.
- Rendering of note is sub-optimal, BG + lines + attack, etc. D2D batches if same shader.
- Instrument folders + collapse entire sections (samples, arps, etc.)
- Sign exe/setup on Windows (EV cert is too expensive) + Sign/notarize on MacOS (dont want to pay for developper ID).
- Mac: Paste special: Text is super dark
- Mac: Clicking on FS without the window doesn't give it focus...?
- Installer on Japanese machine?
- Keyboard recording VS. non-QWERTY keyboards.
- BUG: After cleanup, selected arpeggio + instrument seems wrong. (added notes make arpeggion sound, but none selected.)
- Highlight piano keys when they are pressed with QWERTY or MIDI. (LOW PRIO)
