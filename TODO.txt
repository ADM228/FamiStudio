3.3.1
=====
- Include Demo instruments!!
- Crash tempo?
- Crash github
- Warning EPSM ROM from twitter.
- Threading issue ComputeNumberOfFrameForGroove needs a lock.

4.0.0
=====
P0:
- Context menu polish:.
	- Review all tooltips (lots of {MouseRight} left for delete, etc.)
	- Tooltips where a context menu can appear.
	- When opening a context menu, its annoying that we cant select afterwards (right click), it keeps opening a new menu... Confusing...
	- Sequencer : Add select all there too?
- Widgets:
	- Recolor all icons to white, use filter on Android to make them grey.
	- Make sure we use the lightest grey (grey2) for all text. Or maybe not, we use it for highlight...
	x IsAsyncDialogInProgress, must implement on PC.
	- Remove all using RenderXXX, rename properly.
	- Rename ScaleFOrMainWIndow
	- All dialogs will need to be async, no more "ShowDialog". Actually with GLFW we can.
	- Pass form to dialogs, avoid ugly .INstance thing.
- GLFW:
	- ***** TO DERISK:
    / DPI awareness => glfwGetMonitorContentScale, TEST!
    / Keyboard keys
    / Capture
    - Resizing issue.
    / Horizontal mouse wheel
    - Pinch to zoom?
  - Clear window to grey as soon as its created, nicer during loading.
  - Merge FamiStudioControls <-> Forms.
  - Window icon.
  - Split in more folders, think of stuff that is kind of standalone (graphics, etc.)
	- Remove all dependencies to WinForms, GTK, System.Drawing, etc.
- MAKE SURE I DIDNT MESS UP THE DEMO SONGS! I SUBMITTED TONS OF SHIT.
P1:
- Validation errors in JTS when deleting some instruments.
- Android : Starting scroll on a slider (in vrc7 instrument) changes the value. How to fix???
- Cleanup : remove duplicated fx values (ex: same volume applied multiple times)
- Improve snapping. (Ask Infu for feedback, he showed an app that he found intuitive)
	=> Way to temporarely disable snapping (FL studio does it with ALT).
	=> Context menu option to set the snapping to the length of a note ("snapping eyedropper")
- Improve oscilloscope stability (min square norm?)
- Improve no-attack.
- Scroll bar in sequencer (option to limit seq size to xx%)
- Volume/effect scaling, easy one we have context menus.
P2:
- Rewrite that crazy ugly function in sound engine + figure out how to have more (change volume or double-special code for rare ones).
- ffmpeg path on Linux should work on path (Puna on CC discord).
- Uncompressed envelopes
- CLI only EXE (Linux only).
- Paste special, option to rename patterns.
- C0 is hidden by scroll bars
- C0 is hidden in piano roll video
- Piano roll scale on desktop?
- Poppin issue on FDS? See messages from "JHÄ€KRI" on discord. Change volume on FDS with a blank waveform.

Testing:
========
- Restest slide notes on mobile, make sure gizmo is stable on both sides when releasing(up/down)
- 

Linux notes 
=========== 
- When slow startup in VM : dbus-launch --exit-with-session mono FamiStudio.exe 
- GTK# : sudo apt-get install gtk-sharp2  
	- This seem to be enough (sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-cil) 
- How to recompile with old linux: 
	- Ubuntu 16.04.6 
	- Install cmake-gui 
	- OpenAL Soft 
		- Install ALSA libs (libasound2-dev) 
		- Download openal-soft code 
		- Run cmake-gui in /build folder. 
		- Configure 
		- Choose static C + C++ libs 
		- Choose Release (no debug info) 
		- Generate. 
		- make! 
	- OGG:
		- Download ogg/vorbis code
		- cmake-gui, static lib, configure
		- CMakeFiles/vorbis.dir/flags.make, add -fPIC
			C_FLAGS = -O3 -DNDEBUG -fPIC 
		- Same for OGG
	- NesSndEmu + NotSoFatso, run script. 
	- RtMidi, need to add static C/C++ libs to cmake file. 
 
MacOS notes
===========
- MacOS Sierra, fully patched is 10.12.6, with AppKit version 1504.83.101
- Must compile the MacLauncher with this to link to the AppKit version that
  matches GTK+2. This will make MacOS load these older versions afterwards,
  even on more recent OS'es.
- Must compile vorbis on old version too (like Sierra). 
- If problem installing MacOS VM, see @DOUG fix at

- If NAT network doesnt work (problem is only in Monterey right now) do that:
	ethernet0.virtualDev = "vmxnet3"

- Chroma: -20

Backlog: 
=========
- ROM export with expansion?
- More options for oscilloscope (https://github.com/maxim-zhao/SidWizPlus/wiki)
- Overclocking (2x, 3x, 4x would be a good start).
- NSF import read DMC initial value.
- Save snapping + qwerty settings + some export settings.
- Left/right pan with +/- (cubase style)?
- TailWindz : CTRL + Scroll should do "something"
- Hardware sweep (how to not conflict with smooth vibrato?)
- Scales
- Loop prevention for envelope (brad issue). 
- Raw FDS modulation table envelope. 
- Instrument folders + collapse entire sections (samples, arps, etc.)
