2.2.0
=====
- Play right note when dragging.
- BUG: Select expansions instrument, change expansions, will delete the exp instruments, old instrument still referenced and can draw in track.
	- Also, if an arpeggio was selected, gets confused. Audio still plays arpeggio, but does not add to piano roll.
- Documentation : 
	- Arpeggio.
	- Recording mode.
- Option to not play notes when dragging.
- Drag seek bar (github issue request!).
- Instrument picker?
- MATTT

Linux notes
===========
- When slow startup in VM : dbus-launch --exit-with-session mono FamiStudio.exe
- GTK# : sudo apt-get install gtk-sharp2 
	- This seem to be enough (sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-cil)
- How to recompile with old linux:
	- Ubuntu 16.04.6
	- Install cmake-gui
	- OpenAL Soft
		- Install ALSA libs (libasound2-dev)
		- Download openal-soft code
		- Run cmake-gui in /build folder.
		- Configure
		- Choose static C + C++ libs
		- Choose Release (no debug info)
		- Generate.
		- make!
	- NesSndEmu + NotSoFatso, run script.
	- RtMidi, need to add static C/C++ libs to cmake file.

Trailer/scroll
==============
- Stashed in 5beed88a1bc487ec2cbc725b9d749a464e57dece.

MkDocs
======
- Install Python
- pip install mkdocs
- pip install mkdocs-bootswatch

Backlog:
=========
- Raw FDS modulation table envelope.
- Rendering of note is sub-optimal, BG + lines + attack, etc. D2D batches if same shader.
- Instrument folders
- Sign exe/setup on Windows (EV cert is too expensive) + Sign/notarize on MacOS (dont want to pay for developper ID).
- Mac: Paste special: Text is super dark
- Mac: Clicking on FS without the window doesn't give it focus...?
- Installer on Japanese machine?
- FamiTracker tempo mode never plays the 1st frame in the NSF.
