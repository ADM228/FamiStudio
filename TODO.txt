Linux notes 
=========== 
- When slow startup in VM : dbus-launch --exit-with-session mono FamiStudio.exe 
- GTK# : sudo apt-get install gtk-sharp2  
	- This seem to be enough (sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-cil) 
- How to recompile with old linux: 
	- Ubuntu 16.04.6 
	- Install cmake-gui 
	- OpenAL Soft 
		- Install ALSA libs (libasound2-dev) 
		- Download openal-soft code 
		- Run cmake-gui in /build folder. 
		- Configure 
		- Choose static C + C++ libs 
		- Choose Release (no debug info) 
		- Generate. 
		- make! 
	- OGG:
		- Download ogg/vorbis code
		- cmake-gui, static lib, configure
		- CMakeFiles/vorbis.dir/flags.make, add -fPIC
			C_FLAGS = -O3 -DNDEBUG -fPIC 
		- Same for OGG
	- NesSndEmu + NotSoFatso, run script. 
	- RtMidi, need to add static C/C++ libs to cmake file. 
 
MacOS notes
===========
- If problem installing MacOS VM, see @DOUG fix at
  https://www.geekrar.com/how-to-fix-the-cpu-has-been-disabled-by-the-guest-os/
	cpuid.0.eax = "0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:1011"
	cpuid.0.ebx = "0111:0101:0110:1110:0110:0101:0100:0111"
	cpuid.0.ecx = "0110:1100:0110:0101:0111:0100:0110:1110"
	cpuid.0.edx = "0100:1001:0110:0101:0110:1110:0110:1001"
	cpuid.1.eax = "0000:0000:0000:0001:0000:0110:0111:0001"
	cpuid.1.ebx = "0000:0010:0000:0001:0000:1000:0000:0000"
	cpuid.1.ecx = "1000:0010:1001:1000:0010:0010:0000:0011"
	cpuid.1.edx = "0000:0111:1000:1011:1111:1011:1111:1111"
- NAT network doesnt work, try using NAT (select only ethernet) + do that:
	ethernet0.virtualDev = "vmxnet3"

FamiStudio 3.1.0 (Small quality of life release)
================================================
x Patterns one-based, start at one.
x Force reload FDS/N163/VRC7 instrument when song is playing and the user tweaks stuff.
x Remove mapping.sample null check.
x Multiple sample import. => Or import samples from other projects?
x Stereo WAV/MP3/Video?
x .exportzp FAMISTUDIO_SFX_CH0 (brad issue)
x True portable mode (save FamiStudio.ini in same folder).
x Move "relative pitch env" to param.
x Is it needed to clear the undo/redo stack when saving? Make it an option? (What about when we add the filename?)
	=> Will always ask to save...
x Replace checklistbox.
x More verts in video osc?
x Compare noise channel in metal crusher.
x Look at changes in Nes_Osc
x OGG export.
x Make sure osc in video are flipped (3.0.2 fix, but video files have changed).
x Loop in selection for sequencer.
x Highlight piano keys when they are pressed with QWERTY or MIDI. 
x BUG! Slider texture format in mixer displays "0:N1".
x Metronome 
x CRASH! Copy VRC6 envelope to normal instrument, play => Crash @Steo
x BUG: Retina dialog position (2x too far)
x MacOS : Does MIDI work still? @bluegestalt crashes, works on my side...
x Sample display semitones + cents. (Could do "15 (C11 -17.9c)", not sure useful). Need something like -5s, 30 cents notations. Nonstandard. -530 cents?
x DPCM instrument: double-click starts/end transaction. Add threshold for capture op.
x Fine pitch adjust in DPCM editor. Make backward, save in file.
x FTI issue jrowe.
/ Oscilloscope export. 
	=> Dont render frame lines in video.
x Remove diacritics in text boxes.
x TailWindz : Scroll bar thickness.
/ OpenTK PR!
- Square selection.
- Make auto scrolling even more gradual on Linux/MacOS.
- Review OnMouseCaptureChanged, not good when playing with params.
- Save snapping + qwerty settings + some export settings.
- Volume/effect scaling?
- Merge CC65 stuff (when back in main branch).
- TailWindz : CTRL + Scroll should do "something"
- Noise slides
	- Documentation (sound engine, FT)
	/ Make sure enabled on ROM + NSF.
- Volume slides.
	- Add max distance (256?) too.
	- Paste/delete special
	- Unit test.
	- Documentation.
	/ Enable in ROM/NSF.

- LOW PRIO : Left/right pan with +/- (cubase style)?

Doc
===
- Add replace instrument (with selection) info
- Gopnick errors
	1. Two attributes are missing, Instrument->Vrc6SawMasterVolume and Note->Release (legacy stuff?)
	2. The "general structure" part suggests "PatternInstance" as a child of "Song" while the indentation in the actual files indicates that it's a child of "Channel"

Testing
=======
- Re-test song merge a lot. Removed a few cleanups.
- Re-test expansions issue (same instrument name, diff expansions, etc.)
- Stereo video crackles?
- WS clips children on win7
- Test OGG a bit more, make sure UI + command line works good
- Double check osc flipping in toolbar + video
- Test ROM with noise/volume slides.

Random features ideas
=====================
- Overclocking (2x, 3x, 4x would be a good start). Would need to switch to a ROM with IRQ, MMC3? 
- Volume slides (how to make user friendly?)
- Hardware sweep (how to not conflict with smooth vibrato?)
- Write delta counter (Zxx).
- Noise slides.
- Multi-expansions (dont want that garbage in the sound engine, would need to be a seperate NSF thing).
- Oscilloscope only video mode.

Backlog: 
========= 
- Cleanup seq/project explorer like piano roll. Nothing crazy, but basic cleanup.
- Scales
- Selection with min/max note.
- Loop prevention for envelope (brad issue). 
- Raw FDS modulation table envelope. 
- Instrument folders + collapse entire sections (samples, arps, etc.) 
- Sign exe/setup on Windows (EV cert is too expensive) + Sign/notarize on MacOS (dont want to pay for developper ID). 
- Installer on Japanese machine?
