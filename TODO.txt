1.5.0: FDS + PAL
================
- FDS:
	- Project explorer advanced instrument params (move relative pitch env there).
- Duty cycle envelopes.
- Fine pitch track
- PAL support/tempo/speed:
	- Delayed cut + delayed note. This will allow us to to song without time = 1
		- Delayed note delays the whole row, not just the note. Which is good i guess, it makes it behave like a real not at a tick level.
		- What happens if you have a note at the 6th frame when running on PAL (which only has 5)???
- ROM export (Mapper 31):
	- Song change + controls (Need gamepad fix to prevent DPCM interference).
- Remove jump and skip effects:
	- Jump is simply a loop point
	- Skip is a shorter pattern.


========================

Backlog:
- Raw FDS modulation table envelope.
- Instrument folders
- All expansions.
- NSF import(would need fine pitch track, anything else? We can create multiple instruments for duty).
- Cleanup (merge duplicated patterns, instruments, remove unused stuff.
- Fix crash on startup when there are no audio device 
- Proper error messages when something fails (save, etc.)
- Add taskbar progress bar + color to show playback state
- Sign exe/setup on Windows (EV cert is too expensive) + Sign/notarize on MacOS (dont want to pay for developper ID).
- Rendering of note is sub-optimal, BG + lines + attack, etc. D2D batches if same shader.
