1.4.0: VRC6
===========
- GOAL: Play Shovel Knight first track.

- Fix all MATTT (asm too, 0x30 default duty is wrong...)
- FamiTracker TXT import/export. Compare, must match exactly on behavior.
- Fix Mac version.
- FTI: Pitch discrepency between VRC6 and 2A03. Seems like 2A03 needs to be flipped, but not VRC6. Investigate...
- NSF: Variable size.
- Shovel Knight song:
	- Noise track has weird 1 beat offset. Might need to start envelope at zero + move.
	
- TESTING:
	- NSF: Restest all songs, old FT2, etc.
	- NSF: Try putting multiple things at once: volume + slide, volume + jump, etc. etc. Must all work.
	- NSF: Retest volume tracks
	- Piano roll, selection, etc. Delete stuff, make sur FX and everything is consitent.
	- Retest copy paste a lot...
	- Note drawing, release, stop, from far away.
	- Reset everywhere i changed to note.Clear();

F1 -> F2
0x0500 = 1280
0x0280 = 640


1.5.0: FDS
==========
- FDS support in NesSndEmu 
- Instrument refactoring (base class + derived?)
- 

========================
Backlog:
- Cleanup (merge duplicated patterns, instruments, remove unused stuff.
- Instrument folders
- PAL support
- Fix crash on startup when there are no audio device 
- Proper error messages when something fails (save, etc.)
- Add taskbar progress bar + color to show playback state
- Sign exe/setup on Windows (EV cert is too expensive) + Sign/notarize on MacOS (dont want to pay for developper ID).
