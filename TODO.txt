Tips & Tricks
=============
#00 - Basic controls & onboarding (pan, zoom, trackpad, tooltips, piano roll view rect, demo songs)
#01 - Sequencer basics (pattern add, delete, edit, instance & copy).
#02 - Piano roll basics (add note, delete note, snapping, dragging, select, transpose with KB).
#03 - Channels in piano roll (force display, muting & soloing, etc.)
#04 - Volume envelopes & release notes
#05 - Toggling note attacks (combination with release)
#06 - Slide notes (combination with release notes)
#07 - Pitch envelopes (absolute & relative, paste text values)
#08 - Effect panel (speed, FDS mod, etc.)
#09 - Quickly copy notes
#10 - Copy & paste (special paste, mix paste, drag & copy, between projects, etc.)
#11 - Custom pattern settings & loop points.
#12 - Recording with Keyboard or MIDI controller (page up/down, keys, etc.)
#13 - Importing instruments
#14 - Importing from FamiTracker
#15 - Importing NSFs (bit reverse, etc.)
#16 - FamiStudio vs. FamiTracker tempo (PAL, etc.)
#17 - DPCM samples (import, save, etc)
#18 - Replacing an instrument by another (copy envelopes, etc.)
#19 - Arpeggios (replacing, etc.)
#20 - Exporting to FamiTracker
#21 - Exporting to a NSF / ROM / FDS Disk
#22 - FDS audio (waveform, modulation, etc.)
#23 - VRC7 audio (release envelope)
#24 - N163 audio (wavetable, number of channels => quality, etc.)
#25 - Command line processing 

2.3.0
=====
CLOSING:
- Update documentation (sound engine, copy/delete special, new nomenclature for bars, tempo, etc.)
	- Update sound engine code size at the end.
	- Tempo : After the rain tempo screenshot makes no sense! (37.5 BPM). 
- Look at all the demo songs, make sure their BPMs are sensical. 
- Make Gimmick samples real notes.
- Retire FT2 friendly songs.

TESTING:
========
- Test speed/custom pattern settings a lot. Both FT and FS tempo mode.
- Re-test FamiStudio text import/export.
- Unit test : add note + cut delays (create a special FamiTracker tempo, with some random expansion). With slides too.
- Test video with scaling.
- Test note labels in 150 + 200% scaling.
- Test paste special on mac + hi-dpi.
- mp3/wav command line export.
- Rested hi-dpi, changed some stuff for video.
- Test export dialog hi-dpi (that ffmpeg button has harcoded 40 height)
- Test modal log export window on MacOS + event processing might be missing?
- Re-test ROM export.
- Re-test ffmpeg export on all platforms (added quotes).
- Re-test FamiTone2 export.

2.3.0 New Features
==================
- MP3 export
- Video export
- Sound engine code size reduction
- Song merge
- Vxx support
- Special paste improvements (repeat, effects, etc.)
- Special delete
- Copy patterns to different channels
- Note labels
- FamiTracker tempo improvements
	- Delayed notes
	- Delayed cuts
- DPCM improvements (explicity bit reverse option, drag&drop)

Linux notes
===========
- When slow startup in VM : dbus-launch --exit-with-session mono FamiStudio.exe
- GTK# : sudo apt-get install gtk-sharp2 
	- This seem to be enough (sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-cil)
- How to recompile with old linux:
	- Ubuntu 16.04.6
	- Install cmake-gui
	- OpenAL Soft
		- Install ALSA libs (libasound2-dev)
		- Download openal-soft code
		- Run cmake-gui in /build folder.
		- Configure
		- Choose static C + C++ libs
		- Choose Release (no debug info)
		- Generate.
		- make!
	- NesSndEmu + NotSoFatso, run script.
	- RtMidi, need to add static C/C++ libs to cmake file.

Backlog:
=========
- Drag seek bar
- Instrument picker
- Raw FDS modulation table envelope.
- Rendering of note is sub-optimal, BG + lines + attack, etc. D2D batches if same shader.
- Instrument folders
- Sign exe/setup on Windows (EV cert is too expensive) + Sign/notarize on MacOS (dont want to pay for developper ID).
- Mac: Paste special: Text is super dark
- Mac: Clicking on FS without the window doesn't give it focus...?
- Installer on Japanese machine?
- FamiTracker tempo mode never plays the 1st frame in the NSF.
- Keyboard recording VS. non-QWERTY keyboards.
