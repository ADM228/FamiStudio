1.5.0: FDS + PAL
================
- Delayed cut + delayed note. This will allow us to to song without time = 1
	- Delayed note delays the whole row, not just the note. Which is good i guess, it makes it behave like a real not at a tick level.
	- What happens if you have a note at the 6th frame when running on PAL (which only has 5)???
x FDS support in NesSndEmu 
- FDS "envelope" in piano roll.
- Project explorer advanced instrument params (move relative pitch env there).
- Instrument folders
- PAL support
- ROM export (Mapper 31):
	- Song change + controls (Need gamepad fix to prevent DPCM interference).


========================

Backlog:
- Cleanup (merge duplicated patterns, instruments, remove unused stuff.
- Fix crash on startup when there are no audio device 
- Proper error messages when something fails (save, etc.)
- Add taskbar progress bar + color to show playback state
- Sign exe/setup on Windows (EV cert is too expensive) + Sign/notarize on MacOS (dont want to pay for developper ID).
- Rendering of note is sub-optimal, BG + lines + attack, etc. D2D batches if same shader.
