Backlog: 
========= 
- When resizing, move the release if its at the end?
- End of song looping behavior?
- Multiple sample import. => Or import samples from other projects?
- Loop prevention for envelope (brad issue). 
- Left/right pan with +/- (cubase style)?
- Stereo WAV/MP3/Video?
- Loop in selection for sequencer.
- Raw FDS modulation table envelope. 
- Instrument folders + collapse entire sections (samples, arps, etc.) 
- Sign exe/setup on Windows (EV cert is too expensive) + Sign/notarize on MacOS (dont want to pay for developper ID). 
- Installer on Japanese machine? 
- Highlight piano keys when they are pressed with QWERTY or MIDI.
