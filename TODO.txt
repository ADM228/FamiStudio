2.1.0
=====
- PAL mode editing.
	- FamiTone2FS
	- Remove debug print in Player when done.
- Slides in NSF dont take PAL into account? (subtract the pitch of both notes, take max???. TODO: PAL.)
- MATTT
- Are trackpad controls changing the tooltips correctly?
- Recompile ROM just to be sure.

Testing
=======
- Test snap a lot (DPCM, All tempo, custom pattern, etc).
- Retest snapping with various pattern sizes.
- NSF A LOT! Export NSF and reimport to make sure skips/double frames are good.
	- Test the release fix I did for slides.
- Playback: FamiTracker, FamiStudio, all mix, compare with old version, etc.
- Register player : PAL/NTSC, FamiTracker/FamiStudio.
- Retest FamiTracker tempo exports (ROM, NSF, etc).
- Make sure play starts exactly at the node the seek bar is (DPCM test).
- Command line on Mac (Linux tested).

2.2.0
=====
- FDS export
- FamiStudio sound engine
	- Should I clamp the period? Why did I remove the clamps???
- Show piano roll rect in sequencer
- 

Tweet ideas
===========
- Tweet the linux screenshots, find a dev who wants to help.
- Tips of the week or something, animated GIFs.

MaxWar wish list.
=================
- Copy patterns to other channels.
- Option for no-sound when no-pattern?
- Loop end point
- MIDI import/export.
	
Linux notes
===========
- When slow startup in VM : dbus-launch --exit-with-session mono FamiStudio.exe
- GTK# : sudo apt-get install gtk-sharp2 
	- This seem to be enough (sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-cil)
- How to recompile with old linux:
	- Ubuntu 16.04.6
	- Install cmake-gui
	- OpenAL Soft
		- Install ALSA libs (libasound2-dev)
		- Download openal-soft code
		- Run cmake-gui in /build folder.
		- Configure
		- Choose static C + C++ libs
		- Choose Release (no debug info)
		- Generate.
		- make!
	- NesSndEmu + NotSoFatso, run script.
	- RtMidi, need to add static C/C++ libs to cmake file.

Backlog:
=========
- P1: Fix crash on startup when there are no audio device (also freeze when switching audio devices)
- P1: Proper error messages when something fails (save, etc.)
- P2: Raw FDS modulation table envelope.
- P2: Rendering of note is sub-optimal, BG + lines + attack, etc. D2D batches if same shader.
- P2: Instrument folders
- P2: Sign exe/setup on Windows (EV cert is too expensive) + Sign/notarize on MacOS (dont want to pay for developper ID).
- P2: Mac: Paste special: Text is super dark
- P2: Mac: Clicking on FS without the window doesn't give it focus...?
- P2: Installer on Japanese machine?
