Tips & Tricks
=============
x #00 - Basic controls & onboarding (pan, zoom, trackpad, tooltips, piano roll view rect, demo songs)
x #01 - Sequencer basics (pattern add, delete, edit, instance & copy).
x #02 - Piano roll basics (add note, delete note, snapping, dragging, select, transpose with KB).
x #03 - Channels in piano roll (force display, muting & soloing, etc.)
#04 - Volume envelopes & release notes
#05 - Toggling note attacks (combination with release)
#06 - Slide notes (combination with release notes)
#07 - Pitch envelopes (absolute & relative, paste text values)
#08 - Effect panel (speed, FDS mod, etc.)
#09 - Quickly copy notes
#10 - Copy & paste (special paste, mix paste, drag & copy, between projects, etc.)
#11 - Custom pattern settings & loop points.
#12 - Recording with Keyboard or MIDI controller (page up/down, keys, etc.)
#13 - Importing instruments
#14 - Importing from FamiTracker
#15 - Importing NSFs (bit reverse, etc.)
#16 - FamiStudio vs. FamiTracker tempo (PAL, etc.)
#17 - DPCM samples (import, save, etc)
#18 - Replacing an instrument by another (copy envelopes, etc.)
#19 - Arpeggios (replacing, etc.)
#20 - Exporting to FamiTracker
#21 - Exporting to a NSF / ROM / FDS Disk
#22 - FDS audio (waveform, modulation, etc.)
#23 - VRC7 audio (release envelope)
#24 - N163 audio (wavetable, number of channels => quality, etc.)
#25 - Command line processing 

2.3.0
=====
- Enhanced FamiTracker compatibility.
	- Delayed notes.
	- Delayed cuts.
	x Vxx.
	- Tempo changes.
	- Fix 1 frame missing in NSF
	- Fix computation of slide notes in FamiTracker tempo mode.
	- Think of FTM import, slide conversions, etc.
- Video export:
	- Test with scaling.
	- Thin release notes seem off by 1 px?
	x Blue lines shovel knight?
	x ffmpeg location
	- linux/macos
/ Song merge 
	x Add unique ID validation.
	x fix instrument import... very bad.
	- Add logging so that people understand name conflicts, DPCM conflicts, etc.
- Dont change scroll in pianoroll/sequencer when undoing + playing + follow to avoid jumps
/ ROM (add new features) + Update to 2.3.0
- Sound engine demo, re-export data at the very end.
- Update documentation (sound engine, copy/delete special, etc.)
- BUG: Dont display label on released notes.
- BUG: If you start selecting in the header in sequencer (right click) and go outside the window, it starts a drag!
- BUG: Missing page up/down on MacOS.
- BUG: Linux, inconsistencies between GTK/OpenTK keyboard reads... Get rid of Open TK!
- RESIZE ALL NSF BINARIES, THEY GOT SMALLER!

=> Configure QWERTY keys for piano input? Will be super annoying to do, need to do on all 3 platforms...

TESTING:
- Create famistudio unit tests from 2.2.1 (either through WAV or register player)
- Add new unit test for Vxx, Famitracker tempo, etc.
- Test note labels in 150 + 200% scaling.
- Test paste special on mac + hi-dpi.
- mp3/wav command line export.
- Rested hi-dpi, changed some stuff for video.

Delay notes
===========
- If there are both a delay + delayed cut, the note delay takes precedence, and the delayed cut starts counting from when the delayed note kicks it.
	C-4
	D-4 G08 S04
- Every time we advance to the next note
	- If there was a note delayed, it is played immediated if there arent any new note. If there is a new note the delayed note is played, then the new one. Making the delayed note inaudible (but it is applied).
	- If there was a queued cut, it is aborted.
- Delayed cuts can go for very long.
	advance = update tempo
	for each channel
		if (advance || (has delayed note && delay == 0))
			if (has delayed note)
				advance row
			advance row
		
x) Change NSF to loop over channels, no more macro shit. 
2) In FamiTracker mode, advance check will need to be inside the loop.
3) Convert to other assemblers.
	
Linux notes
===========
- When slow startup in VM : dbus-launch --exit-with-session mono FamiStudio.exe
- GTK# : sudo apt-get install gtk-sharp2 
	- This seem to be enough (sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-cil)
- How to recompile with old linux:
	- Ubuntu 16.04.6
	- Install cmake-gui
	- OpenAL Soft
		- Install ALSA libs (libasound2-dev)
		- Download openal-soft code
		- Run cmake-gui in /build folder.
		- Configure
		- Choose static C + C++ libs
		- Choose Release (no debug info)
		- Generate.
		- make!
	- NesSndEmu + NotSoFatso, run script.
	- RtMidi, need to add static C/C++ libs to cmake file.

Backlog:
=========
- Drag seek bar
- Instrument picker
- Raw FDS modulation table envelope.
- Rendering of note is sub-optimal, BG + lines + attack, etc. D2D batches if same shader.
- Instrument folders
- Sign exe/setup on Windows (EV cert is too expensive) + Sign/notarize on MacOS (dont want to pay for developper ID).
- Mac: Paste special: Text is super dark
- Mac: Clicking on FS without the window doesn't give it focus...?
- Installer on Japanese machine?
- FamiTracker tempo mode never plays the 1st frame in the NSF.
