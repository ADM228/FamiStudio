1.4.0: VRC6
===========
Polish:
- 

Shovel Knight:
- Noise track has weird 1 beat offset. Might need to start envelope at zero + move.

Testing:
- NSF: Restest all songs, old FT2, etc.
- NSF: Try putting multiple things at once: volume + slide, volume + jump, etc. etc. Must all work.
- NSF: Retest volume tracks
- Piano roll, selection, etc. Delete stuff, make sur FX and everything is consitent.
- Retest copy paste a lot...
- Note drawing, release, stop, from far away.
- Reset everywhere i changed to note.Clear();

1.5.0: FDS
==========
- FDS support in NesSndEmu 
- FDS "envelope" in piano roll.
- Instrument refactoring? (base class + derived?)

========================
Backlog:
- Cleanup (merge duplicated patterns, instruments, remove unused stuff.
- Instrument folders
- PAL support
- Fix crash on startup when there are no audio device 
- Proper error messages when something fails (save, etc.)
- Add taskbar progress bar + color to show playback state
- Sign exe/setup on Windows (EV cert is too expensive) + Sign/notarize on MacOS (dont want to pay for developper ID).
