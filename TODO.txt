LH778 Android
=======

Big tasks left:
- Finish all controls (PR Effect + DPCM)

Piano roll:
- Create/Change effect value 
- Clear effect value
- Map/clear DPCM sample
- Move DPCM mapping 
- Draw line that seperates with toolbar + quick access.
- Clicking should toggle cursor.
- Test : envelope selection, copy paste, etc.

Sequencer:
- Paste should happen at cursor, not selection? Must be consistent with PR.

Scaling issue:
x Support 3 scalings (Will not affect toolbars)? 
	- 4x (with 2x font) (Default for <  1080p, xhdpi and below)
	- 6x (with 3x font) (Default for >= 1080p, or xxhdpi)
	- 8x (with 4x font) (Default for >= 1440p, or xxxhdpi)

Testing:
- Test copy/paste/cut/delete in all cases (need to be able to delete samples too)

Polish (if time):
- Margins for auto-scroll, migrate all to new function.
- Hide more stuff in the settings
- Some dialogs look bad (special paste, cleanup, etc.)
- Tutorial (post-beta?)
- Option to hide piano in piano roll? (would need octave labels)
- When in instrument editor, if channel is DPCM, you get invalid instrument error, but cant switch to DPCM instrument. COnfusing.
- Env editor : clicking again on highlight should remove it?
- Dont do a fling when the transaction we are ending is a selection. Weird.
- BUG : When moving mouse out of project explorer towards piano roll, the sequencer icon dont change back.
- BUG : FDS Waveform on mobile doesnt have the right range it seems.

Icon notes:
- 46% zoom, start with 128x128 png.

3.2.0
=====
- Copy instrument.
- Change insturment dialog for a combo

DPCM/Tri volume thing (from tromino)
- Run more tests on NES, with more volumes + noise too.
- Add a global 80% volume to match FamiTracker.
- Channels will need to be rebalanced a bit since i bumped the squares.
- Compare with old FamiStudio to see if old project will sound like ass.
	
Misc:
- Mac/Linux : CheckListBox doesnt fire events (needed for Midi import/PAL).
- Mac/Linux : Make sure piano roll maximize layout works, and also that sequencer doesnt render when disabled.
- Make sure OnMouseLeave works on that too.
- Fix GTK single multiple label issue.	

Testing
=======
- Add multi-exp unit test.
- Test project/instrument merge (with expansions).
- Retest with various scaling (lots of cahnges to everything, zooming, etc.)
- Test without snapping, i tested snapping a lot, but not witout.
- Compare instrument colors (seq/piano roll) for all platforms
- Re-test last open file.
- Occasional crash when opening hopes and dreams on Android. 
- Test light/dark modes.
- Linux seem to support 150% scaling as well, make sure the fonts are there.
- From Perkka "when you try to quit no using cmd+q or the red close button in the corner of the windows you get a question if you want to save first so all fine and dandy, but if you rightclick on the application icon in the dock and chose quit you'll never get that question, it'll just quit and stuff will be lost"

Packaging:
==========
- Make download list vertical on website.
- Update DLLs to VS 2019 + Package redist.
- Recompile everything (ROM, NSF, etc). Make sure it says 3.2.0.

Features missing from the Mobile version
========================================
- No MIDI import/export

Videos:
=======
- Mobile tutorial? Or just a documentation page with a bunch of GIFs?
- Tutorial for FamiTracker

Linux notes 
=========== 
- When slow startup in VM : dbus-launch --exit-with-session mono FamiStudio.exe 
- GTK# : sudo apt-get install gtk-sharp2  
	- This seem to be enough (sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-cil) 
- How to recompile with old linux: 
	- Ubuntu 16.04.6 
	- Install cmake-gui 
	- OpenAL Soft 
		- Install ALSA libs (libasound2-dev) 
		- Download openal-soft code 
		- Run cmake-gui in /build folder. 
		- Configure 
		- Choose static C + C++ libs 
		- Choose Release (no debug info) 
		- Generate. 
		- make! 
	- OGG:
		- Download ogg/vorbis code
		- cmake-gui, static lib, configure
		- CMakeFiles/vorbis.dir/flags.make, add -fPIC
			C_FLAGS = -O3 -DNDEBUG -fPIC 
		- Same for OGG
	- NesSndEmu + NotSoFatso, run script. 
	- RtMidi, need to add static C/C++ libs to cmake file. 
 
MacOS notes
===========
- MacOS Sierra, fully patched is 10.12.6, with AppKit version 1504.83.101
- Must compile the MacLauncher with this to link to the AppKit version that
  matches GTK+2. This will make MacOS load these older versions afterwards,
  even on more recent OS'es.
- Must compile vorbis on old version too (like Sierra). 
- If problem installing MacOS VM, see @DOUG fix at

	cpuid.0.eax = "0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:1011"
	cpuid.0.ebx = "0111:0101:0110:1110:0110:0101:0100:0111"
	cpuid.0.ecx = "0110:1100:0110:0101:0111:0100:0110:1110"
	cpuid.0.edx = "0100:1001:0110:0101:0110:1110:0110:1001"
	cpuid.1.eax = "0000:0000:0000:0001:0000:0110:0111:0001"
	cpuid.1.ebx = "0000:0010:0000:0001:0000:1000:0000:0000"
	cpuid.1.ecx = "1000:0010:1001:1000:0010:0010:0000:0011"
	cpuid.1.edx = "0000:0111:1000:1011:1111:1011:1111:1111"
- If NAT network doesnt work (problem is only in Monterey right now) do that:
	ethernet0.virtualDev = "vmxnet3"

Trailer/scroll 
============== 
- Stashed in 5beed88a1bc487ec2cbc725b9d749a464e57dece. 
 
MkDocs 
====== 
- Install Python 
- pip install mkdocs 
- pip install mkdocs-bootswatch 
 
Discord 
======= 
- Invite link: https://discord.gg/88UPmxh 

3.2.0
=====
- Overclocking (2x, 3x, 4x would be a good start).
- Multi-expansions (dont want that garbage in the sound engine, would need to be a seperate NSF thing).

Backlog: 
=========
- NSF import read DMC initial value.
- Volume/effect scaling?
- Save snapping + qwerty settings + some export settings.
- Left/right pan with +/- (cubase style)?
- TailWindz : CTRL + Scroll should do "something"
- Hardware sweep (how to not conflict with smooth vibrato?)
- Write delta counter (Zxx).
- Scales
- Loop prevention for envelope (brad issue). 
- Raw FDS modulation table envelope. 
- Instrument folders + collapse entire sections (samples, arps, etc.) 
- Sign exe/setup on Windows (EV cert is too expensive) + Sign/notarize on MacOS (dont want to pay for developper ID). 
- Installer on Japanese machine? 
- Square selection: Sort-of works, but problems are with stop notes. To know if a stop note is in the square
  you need the previous note, but that note may just have been deleted (like in DeleteNotes), so its almost
  impossible to do without caching the stop note values.
