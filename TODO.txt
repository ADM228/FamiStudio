2.2.0
=====
- FDS export
- FamiStudio sound engine
	- Remove a bunch of macros, reduce code size
	- Rename stuff
	- Resurect VFX
	- 3 assembly versions : will need a simple test ROM.
	- Deprecate FamiTone2 FS.
	- Should I clamp the period? Why did I remove the clamps???
- Show piano roll rect in sequencer
- Drag seek bar (github issue request!).
- Arpeggio : GOAL, recreate song #4 from silver surfer. (3/4 notes, slow/fast, Micromachines & Jurassic park has 1 frame delay before starting the arp)
	
	- New Category below instrument "Arpeggios".
	- Default "None"
	- They are simply envlopes.
	- See if they need to reset notes (attack) : Look at NSF + FamiTracker.
		- Silver surfer, smurf, MC kids, asterix dont reset
		- 
	- See how FamiTrackers handles vs. instrument envlopes).
	
	-
	- NSF
	- Import export (FT, text format)
	- Replace selection arp
	
	Note drawing:
		- Arpeggio will break culling? Test how slide notes react...
	
	Minor:
		- Should arpeggios even have colors in project explorer?
		- Should I use a "..." icon for arps?
- Instrument picker?
- Discord server

Tweet ideas
===========
- Tweet the linux screenshots, find a dev who wants to help.
- Tips of the week or something, animated GIFs.

MaxWar wish list.
=================
- Copy patterns to other channels.
- Option for no-sound when no-pattern?
- Loop end point
- MIDI import/export.
	
Linux notes
===========
- When slow startup in VM : dbus-launch --exit-with-session mono FamiStudio.exe
- GTK# : sudo apt-get install gtk-sharp2 
	- This seem to be enough (sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-cil)
- How to recompile with old linux:
	- Ubuntu 16.04.6
	- Install cmake-gui
	- OpenAL Soft
		- Install ALSA libs (libasound2-dev)
		- Download openal-soft code
		- Run cmake-gui in /build folder.
		- Configure
		- Choose static C + C++ libs
		- Choose Release (no debug info)
		- Generate.
		- make!
	- NesSndEmu + NotSoFatso, run script.
	- RtMidi, need to add static C/C++ libs to cmake file.

Backlog:
=========
- P1: Fix crash on startup when there are no audio device (also freeze when switching audio devices)
- P1: Proper error messages when something fails (save, etc.)
- P2: Raw FDS modulation table envelope.
- P2: Rendering of note is sub-optimal, BG + lines + attack, etc. D2D batches if same shader.
- P2: Instrument folders
- P2: Sign exe/setup on Windows (EV cert is too expensive) + Sign/notarize on MacOS (dont want to pay for developper ID).
- P2: Mac: Paste special: Text is super dark
- P2: Mac: Clicking on FS without the window doesn't give it focus...?
- P2: Installer on Japanese machine?
- P2: FamiTracker tempo mode never plays the 1st frame in the NSF.
