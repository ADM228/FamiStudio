3.3.1
=====
x Crash cancelling stereo export?
x Crash tempo?
/ Crash github (fixed the UNDO case)
x How2 crash stereo export. Likely same crash.
x Warning EPSM ROM from twitter.
x Threading issue ComputeNumberOfFrameForGroove needs a lock.
x Allow register viewer.

3.4.0
=====
P0:
- Right-click functionality.
	- Tooltips
	- Tooltips where a context menu can appear.
	- Icons
	- Unify ShowMobileContextMenu/ShowDesktopContextMenu
	- Toolbar
		- On mobile, replace the right click by context menus.
	- Sequencer :
		- Pattern area.
	- Piano roll
	- PE
P1:
- Android : Starting scroll on a slider (in vrc7 instrument) changes the value
- Shift-selection (rectangle) in sequencer shouldnt really care if you click in the colored part or not.
- Cleanup : remove duplicated fx values (ex: same volume applied multiple times)
- Improve snapping. (Ask Infu for feedback, he showed an app that he found intuitive)
- Rewrite that crazy ugly function in sound engine + figure out how to have more (change volume or double-special code for rare ones).
- ffmpeg path on Linux should work on path (Puna on CC discord).
- Improve oscilloscope stability (min square norm?)
- Uncompressed envelopes
- Improve no-attack.
P2:
- Volume/effect scaling
- CLI only EXE (Linux only).
- Paste special, option to rename patterns.
- Way to temporarely disable snapping (FL studio does it with ALT).
- Scroll bar in sequencer
- C0 is hidden by scroll bars
- C0 is hidden in piano roll video
- Piano roll scale on desktop?
- Poppin issue on FDS? See messages from "JHÄ€KRI" on discord. Change volume on FDS with a blank waveform.
- Fix GTK leak (GTK 3.x?), or 2.12.45

Linux notes 
=========== 
- When slow startup in VM : dbus-launch --exit-with-session mono FamiStudio.exe 
- GTK# : sudo apt-get install gtk-sharp2  
	- This seem to be enough (sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-cil) 
- How to recompile with old linux: 
	- Ubuntu 16.04.6 
	- Install cmake-gui 
	- OpenAL Soft 
		- Install ALSA libs (libasound2-dev) 
		- Download openal-soft code 
		- Run cmake-gui in /build folder. 
		- Configure 
		- Choose static C + C++ libs 
		- Choose Release (no debug info) 
		- Generate. 
		- make! 
	- OGG:
		- Download ogg/vorbis code
		- cmake-gui, static lib, configure
		- CMakeFiles/vorbis.dir/flags.make, add -fPIC
			C_FLAGS = -O3 -DNDEBUG -fPIC 
		- Same for OGG
	- NesSndEmu + NotSoFatso, run script. 
	- RtMidi, need to add static C/C++ libs to cmake file. 
 
MacOS notes
===========
- MacOS Sierra, fully patched is 10.12.6, with AppKit version 1504.83.101
- Must compile the MacLauncher with this to link to the AppKit version that
  matches GTK+2. This will make MacOS load these older versions afterwards,
  even on more recent OS'es.
- Must compile vorbis on old version too (like Sierra). 
- If problem installing MacOS VM, see @DOUG fix at

- If NAT network doesnt work (problem is only in Monterey right now) do that:
	ethernet0.virtualDev = "vmxnet3"

Backlog: 
=========
- Write delta counter (Zxx).
- ROM export with expansion?
- More options for oscilloscope (https://github.com/maxim-zhao/SidWizPlus/wiki)
- Overclocking (2x, 3x, 4x would be a good start).
- NSF import read DMC initial value.
- Save snapping + qwerty settings + some export settings.
- Left/right pan with +/- (cubase style)?
- TailWindz : CTRL + Scroll should do "something"
- Hardware sweep (how to not conflict with smooth vibrato?)
- Scales
- Loop prevention for envelope (brad issue). 
- Raw FDS modulation table envelope. 
- Instrument folders + collapse entire sections (samples, arps, etc.)
