1.3.0 Roadmap
=============
- Copy/paste support
- Change undo/redo keys on macos
- Sign exe/setup on Windows
- Sign/notarize on MacOS

Copy paste support:
===================
- What can be copy/pasted:
	/ Notes in piano roll
	/ Effect values (==> paste special)
	/ Envelope values.
	- Patterns
- Clipboard format:
	x For notes: a big array of notes.
	- For envelopes: a series of values
	- For sequencer: a 2D array of patterns.
x Icon
x Toolbar
/ Only display selection if control is in focus (confusing, maybe have 2 colors?)
/ Range selection in piano roll
- Range selection in sequencer
x Display notes as selected
/ Paste special (notes only, volume, effects only)
- Clear selection in a bunch of cases (open new file, change song params, etc)
- Make sure can still scroll with mouse when selecting and stuff (scrolling should not be a capture operation maybe?).
- Envelope edition:
	- 2 rows, timeline + loop/release points
		- timeline: left click seek or resize. right click select
		- loop/release: left click loop point, right click release point	
	- When resizing envelope, clamp max selection.
- Mac:
	- Add line width param to GL
	- Up/down/left/right keys wont work
- Clamp selection min/max in ReplaceEnvelopeValues and other. Create a SetSelection function.

/ Clipboard management

========================
Backlog:
- PAL support
- VRC6, FDS, etc.
- Fix crash on startup when there are no audio device 
- Proper error messages when soemthing fails (save, etc.)
- Add taskbar progress bar + color to show playback state
- Freeze on some atom processors?
